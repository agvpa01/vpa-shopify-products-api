Feeling a bit flat before hitting the gym?

Don’t worry, legends! We’ll get you sorted with our top 10 best foods to eat before a workout because what you eat beforehand makes a world of difference. Forget sad salads and wilted celery sticks – we're talking about pre-workout snacks that are as delicious as they are energising. So, chuck another snag on the barbie (well, maybe not literally before a workout) and listen up close! Here are the top 10 pre-workout snacks guaranteed to turn you into a gym legend.

**Remember: Timing is Key!**

Before we dish out delish pre-workout snacks, remember – timing is everything. Ideally, aim to eat your pre-workout snack 1-2 hours before you unleash your inner athlete. This gives your body enough time to digest and convert that food into energy.

The ideal pre-workout snack should be a delightful duet of carbohydrates and protein. Carbs provide sustained energy, while protein helps build and repair muscle. So, let's get this pre-sweat party started!

## 1. The Energising Smoothie Bowl

This beauty is as delicious as it is functional. Blend half a cup of frozen berries with a scoop of [VPA Australia Whey Isolate](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder) (unflavored or choose your favourite flavour!), a splash of unsweetened almond milk, and a dollop of plain Greek yogurt. Pour it into a bowl and top with a sprinkle of granola, a drizzle of honey, and some chia seeds for extra texture.

**Why it works:** This smoothie bowl is a flavour and nutrient explosion. The berries provide a burst of carbs and antioxidants, the whey isolate delivers a protein punch, and the Greek yogurt adds a touch of creaminess and more protein. Granola adds a satisfying crunch, while honey and chia seeds offer a touch of sweetness and healthy fats.

## 2. The Power-Packed Pancakes

Who says pancakes can't be pre-workout fuel? Ditch the sugary syrups and whip up a batch of protein pancakes using [VPA Australia Protein Pancake Mix!](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/protein-pancake-mix/) Add an egg (protein boost!) and some milk for a fluffy batter. Throw in some chopped blueberries for a burst of antioxidants. Cook your pancakes and top them with a drizzle of natural honey for a touch of sweetness.

**Why it's perfect:** Protein pancake mix provides sustained energy (protein), while the egg and blueberries add an extra dose of protein and antioxidants. Honey provides a quick energy source, perfect for that pre-workout push.

## 3. The Scrambled Scramble with a Twist

Scrambled eggs are a classic breakfast option, but let's take it up a notch for pre-workout! Scramble two eggs with chopped spinach and diced red capsicum. Top it with a sprinkle of grated parmesan cheese for a touch of savoury goodness.

**Why it's perfect:** Eggs are a complete protein source, meaning they contain all essential amino acids for muscle building and repair. Spinach is rich in iron, which helps deliver oxygen to your muscles, and capsicum provides vitamin C, another important nutrient for exercise performance.

## 4. The "Ant on a Log" Reinvented

Remember that childhood snack – celery sticks with peanut butter? Let's give it a grown-up makeover! Spread some [VPA Australia Protein Mousse](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/protein-mousse-500g/) on celery sticks for a creamy and protein-rich base. Top it with some sliced almonds for a delightful crunch and healthy fats.

**Why it's perfect:** Celery provides hydration, while protein mousse delivers a sustained energy source. Almonds offer healthy fats and fibre, keeping you feeling fuller for longer.

## 5. The Powerhouse Pita

Whole wheat pita bread is a fantastic base for a pre-workout snack. Fill it with some shredded chicken breast (lean protein!), sliced cucumber and tomato (hydration!), and a dollop of hummus (healthy fats and fibre).

**Why it's perfect:** Chicken breast provides readily available protein, while the veggies keep you hydrated. Hummus adds healthy fats and fiber, keeping you feeling full and focused during your workout.
