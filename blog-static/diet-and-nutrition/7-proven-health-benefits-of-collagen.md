[Collagen is important to your health and well-being](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/supplements/collagen-the-fountain-of-youth?_pos=2&_sid=877e8728c&_ss=r), but you might not realize just how valuable it is. In this article, I'll explain seven proven benefits of taking a collagen supplement.

### 1: IMPROVED SKIN ELASTICITY AND AGING

Collagen has made a strong name for itself for its anti-ageing properties. But what does the science say?

A recent study observed 69 women between the ages of 35 and 55 over eight weeks, who consumed a collagen supplement. The women who consumed the collagen showed significant improvements in skin elasticity compared to the women who took a placebo.

Another study showed that older women in the collagen group experienced more noticeable improvements. It was suggested that because collagen production decreases with as we age which would leave more room for improvement. Other studies have shown improved skin hydration levels with collagen supplementation.

### 2: HEAL LEAKY GUT SYNDROME

For those who suffer from Irritable bowel syndrome (or IBS) and leaky gut syndrome understand how painful it can really be. IBS causes nutrients and toxic substances to be “leaked” back into the bloodstream. This causes negative effects like bloating, fatigue, upset stomach, diarrhea, constipation and malnutrition. Collagen can be helpful as it breaks down proteins and soothes your gut’s protective lining and heals damaged cell walls.

The good news is that collagen helps heal leaky gut syndrome by repairing damaged tissue in the digestive tract so that food particles can no longer pass through it into your bloodstream where they don't belong.

### 3: BRAIN AND ALZHEIMER’S PROTECTION

A study has shown that collagen IV is able to protect the brain against amyloid-beta proteins, one of the causes of Alzheimer’s. Collagen proteins create protection for your brain that combats the amyloid-beta proteins that attack neurons and cause Alzheimer’s disease.

### 4: BOOST METABOLISM

It is well known that as we age our bodies lose muscle mass and gain fat, but collagen can help combat against this. First, the amino acid Glycine which is found in high doses in collagen helps form muscle by converting glucose into energy and having more muscle burns more calories. Second, studies have found that collagen helps ageing individuals maintain lean body muscle and preserve nitrogen balance.

The reason this works is because collagen has been found to increase the production of HGH (human growth hormone). HGH is essential for the body to function properly because it helps with fat burning, muscle building and recovery.

HGH levels naturally decline as we age, so giving our body more can help us maintain muscle mass as we age. This will also allow us to lose weight much easier since excess fat will burn off much faster than usual if we have higher levels of HGH in our bodies.

### 5: REMOVE JOINT AND KNEE PAIN

Studies reveal that shows collagen may be able to relieve joint pain. A 4 month study monitored athletes who consumed a collagen supplement. They found that collagen reduced pain while standing, lifting heavy objects and even at rest. In another study, scientists experimented over 180 days to see if a collagen supplement would affect knee pain, participants experienced lower scores on the osteoarthritis index and less pain, stiffness and physical limitations.

Collagen is the most abundant protein in our bodies. It can be found in bones, skin, and connective tissue, and is responsible for keeping these parts strong and healthy.

Collagen is also an important component of cartilage, the rubbery substance that cushions our joints. [We need collagen to keep our bones and cartilage flexible and lubricated.](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/supplements/collagen-supplementation-for-tendon-repair?_pos=3&_sid=877e8728c&_ss=r)

### 6: LESS BACK PAIN

A study gave 1,200 milligrams of collagen a day (or a placebo) to 200 individuals with back pain and who were over 50 years old, found that within 6 months, over 20 percent of the collagen group saw a significant improvement in their back pain after taking collagen every day.

### 7: SAY GOODBYE TO BRITTLE, BROKEN NAILS

A study of participants who were given 2.5-grams of collagen peptide each day for 4 months experiences on average, a12 percent increase in nail growth, a 42 percent drop in broken nails and a 64 percent overall improvement in formerly brittle nails.

Collagen provides a plethora of health benefits. Whether you are looking for reduced wrinkles and enhanced skin, stronger hair and nails, or better sleep and lower cholesterol levels, collagen is an easy supplement to take.
