### Drink your coffee plain

Research published in the journal *Public Health* show people who drink black coffee instead of adding milk, sugar or syrups consume on average 69 fewer calories per day. However, if you are a coffee addict, this difference could be much higher! If black coffee isn't for you, switch reduced fat milk which will also help lower the energy content of your coffee. Remember that coffee can actually help reduce calories by acting as a natural appetite suppressant.

The flavour of coffee itself is strong enough that you won't even miss all those extra calories from dairy products and sweeteners. If you want even more flavour boost in your cup, try adding some spices like cinnamon or nutmeg for an added kick!

### Get more fibre early in the day

Research published in the *Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism* revealed that people who had oats for breakfast consumed 31% fewer calories over the course of the rest of the day. Choosing a high fibre breakfast helps you feel full, and also puts you in the right frame of mind to carry on eating well for the rest of the day.

### Swap soft drink for carbonated water

If you only cut out 1 can of soft drink a day you will save about 150 calories. “My favorite tip for cutting back on soda is to switch to sparkling water,” says Kristi King. “You can add fruit or even a little sweetener if you want some extra flavor, but even then you’ll be cutting way back on the sugar in soda.” If soda water isn't for you, make the switch to sugar free and still experience the calorie reduction.

Cutting out soft drinks can save you hundreds of calories a day and reduce your risk of heart disease, diabetes and obesity. But you don't have to ban them altogether. Swap them for sparkling water and add natural fruit flavours like orange or lemon to improve the taste.

### Eat more protein

Ideas for high fibre breakfasts include:
1. Baked beans and eggs on multigrain toast.
2. Rolled oats served with yogurt and berries.
3. VPA® Vanilla breakfast shake with added berries
