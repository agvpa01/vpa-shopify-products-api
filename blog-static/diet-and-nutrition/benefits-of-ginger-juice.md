Apple juice, banana juice, cherry juice, we’ve finally made our way down the alphabet to the “G” juice. That’s right- Ginger Juice. You might be sticking your nose up in disgust, or maybe you are one of those people who love the taste and especially, the fresh and flowery scent of ginger. It is very similar to turmeric, cardamom, and galangal as it belongs to the Zingiberaceae family. But did you know that ginger has some great health benefits too? Ginger is also known as Zingiber  officinale. Ginger originated from China and contains Gingerol, a substance with powerful medicinal properties. In fact, there is evidence of use in history over 5000 years ago when the Indians and Chinese used it for a variety of illnesses as it was considered a universal medicine.

Ginger is most well-known for its ability to help with the treatment of nausea and indigestion. In particular, for motion sickness, predominantly sea sickness. Although the present literature is inconsistent with its results on the effectiveness of ginger in aiding nausea, many of studies have found a positive correlation.  In one research, the spice was shown to be more effective in reducing nausea than Dramamine, a prescription typically used to treat motion sickness. Giving sailors 1 gram of ginger lessened the severity of seasickness, according to another study.

It also appears that ginger is able to help fight the symptoms of the flu and common cold. Just like I mentioned above, the literature is often conflicting, but some studies have shown that having ginger can help relieve some of those dreadful cold and flu symptoms.  One study found that ginger helps prevent or soothe a sore throat, reduce congestion, reduce inflammation and prevent colds. How you might ask? Well Ginger has powerful antimicrobial properties. Ginger had a stronger antibacterial impact than drugs against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, according to a 2011 laboratory research. Streptococcal pharyngitis, often known as strep throat, is caused by the bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes.

Ginger is a natural remedy with many health benefits. It can help relieve you from stomach aches, nausea and vomiting. Ginger juice is also effective in fighting cold, cough and flu.

### Here are some of the other benefits of ginger juice:

**1. Reduces Inflammation**
One of the main benefits of ginger juice is its ability to reduce inflammation throughout the body. Inflammation occurs when the body responds to an injury or infection by releasing chemicals that cause blood vessels to expand and become leaky so they can bring extra oxygen-rich blood to the damaged area where healing takes place.

**2. Improves Digestion**
Ginger has a powerful effect on digestion. When taken regularly it helps improve digestion by stimulating the secretion of digestive juices such as hydrochloric acid and pepsin from the stomach. It also helps relieve gas, bloating and nausea associated with indigestion by stimulating bile production and increasing gastric emptying time.

**3. Boosts Immune System**
Ginger contains active compounds called gingerols and shogaols which help to fight infections. It also helps in regulating blood sugar levels and prevents the growth of cancer cells.

**4. Helps Control Blood Pressure**
Ginger contains a compound called gingerol which helps control blood pressure by relaxing blood vessels. This makes it an excellent home remedy for hypertension (high blood pressure).

**5. Reduce Pain**
Ginger has anti-inflammatory properties that help reduce pain from joint inflammation due to arthritis, bursitis and tendonitis. It also reduces swelling and alleviates muscle soreness associated with over exertion such as after exercise or injury.

Not only does ginger have properties to help when you are sick, but also for any exercise-induced muscle pain. Ginger's anti-inflammatory properties can help to relieve muscular discomfort after strenuous exercise. Several in vitro and animal studies revealed ginger extract to be more powerful than the anti-inflammatory chemicals present in aspirin when the efficacy of ginger as a therapy for inflammation and pain was investigated.

Ginger juice is often overlooked as a drink with great health benefits. It has been used for ages to cure stomach ailments, aches and other conditions that are caused by cold weathers. Nowadays we realize that ginger juice is good for many more things, so if you haven't tried it yet, make sure to mix yourself a glass today. If its preparation is too much for you (if you opt for pure ginger juice), you can always grab the ready-to-drink ginger juice.
