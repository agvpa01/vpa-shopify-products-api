### Whether you’re still on the fence about making the switch to a plant-based diet or are just now more ‘plant curious’ after bumping into some recent films and documentaries like [The Game Changers on Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/ph/title/81157840) during isolation, (features impressive elite plant-based athletes) there is no doubt about the powerful impacts this has on our health and our environment.

However, to many who are still in doubt and are quite skeptical, “Can I get enough protein on a plant-based diet?” is still the most asked question today.

**Short answer: Absolutely!**

First of all, protein plays an essential role to our bodies. It helps build and repair muscle to give us strength and mobility and increase fat burning. Although some of the best protein sources are from animal by-products and dairy protein like whey protein powders, it is good to note that plant-based protein works wonderfully as an alternative for plant-based diets especially for plant-based athletes.

Plant-based diets are typically vegetarian (which includes dairy products and eggs with most plant foods) and vegan (which completely eliminates all animal products)

### Protein-on-the-go

If you're trying to get enough protein on a plant-based diet, there are a few things to know.

First, the amount of protein you need depends on your age, weight and activity level. The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for protein is 46 grams per day for women ages 19 to 70, and 56 grams per day for men in that age group.

The RDA is based on a 2,000-calorie diet; if you're eating less than that, you may need more protein. And if you're exercising more than usual — say, by running or lifting weights — then you may need more protein than the RDA suggests.

Second, there are many types of plant foods that contain protein: beans, lentils and peas; soy foods like tofu and tempeh; nuts and seeds; whole grains such as oats and brown rice; leafy green vegetables such as kale and spinach; quinoa (pronounced keen-wah); even certain fruits like avocados and bananas offer some protein benefits.

Protein powders can easily help you meet your daily protein requirements. The best protein powder to buy are dairy protein if your diet allows for it. If not, here’s the lowdown on the difference between the two.

### Whey Protein vs Plant Protein

Whey protein powder is the by-product of the cheese manufacturing process. It is the liquid that is left behind after straining the milk. Because of such process, lactose intolerance is one of the most common side effects from consuming whey protein.

Plant-based protein or vegan protein powders are easier digestible and don’t have the side effects associated with whey protein. They are also full of vitamins and minerals, antioxidants, and fiber.
