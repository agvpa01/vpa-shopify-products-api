### What are carbohydrates?

Your body needs carbohydrates in order to fuel your muscles. Despite following healthy routines and habits, without the right amount of carbohydrates, you are often left feeling weak and low on energy during workouts. This is because carbohydrates are our primary source of energy.

### What are the types of carbohydrates?

There are three types of carbohydrates: starches, fiber, and sugars.

- **Starches** – They are considered complex carbohydrates, which are made up of simple sugars. Starches are broken down by our body to fuel energy.
- **Fibers** – They are considered complex carbohydrates. Eating foods with fiber keep you full. This is because our body is not able to break down most fibers.
- **Sugars** – They are considered simple carbohydrates and can be added to foods. They are found in added sugars in desserts, candy, sodas, etc.

### Importance of carbohydrates on exercise

- **Prevents muscle breakdown**
  Protein and carbohydrates make a great pair. As long as you eat a good amount of carbs, protein can repair and build muscle tissues.

- **Carbs before a workout boosts performance**
  Eating carbs 1-2 hours before your work out helps maintain optimal levels of blood glucose and maximizes the results of your training.

- **They accelerate recovery**
  Eating carbs after a workout is equally as important as eating carbs before a workout. After a long workout, eating carbohydrates will help you replenish the energy that was used up.

### How many carbs should I eat?

The amount can vary from person to person. Multiple factors come into play such as age, sex, lifestyle, dietary restrictions. People should consume 45-65% of their calories from carbohydrates on average daily. However, it is still important to pay attention to which carbs are good to eat. For example, consuming whole grains give you much more nutrients compared to refined grains. Another would be eating foods that are low in fat but high in potassium like beans, lentils, and peas.
