Consistency in training and clean eating go hand-in-hand if you wish to see results in your workout. Clean eating is essentially a diet that is based on eating whole foods and avoiding processed and refined foods. Not only does nutritious food aid in building muscle, but they also fuel up your body for training. By eating the right foods and hydrating in the right amounts at the right times, you will perform better while seeing the best results.

### Before a Workout

It is crucial to fuel up, especially before you do intensive training. It is ideal to do so two hours before. Without any food in your system to aid in your workouts, you won't have enough energy to maximize your exercise, and you will ultimately limit your ability to burn calories.

Before engaging in any physical activity, you must hydrate with water. Eating carbohydrates like whole wheat toast, whole grain cereals, brown rice, pasta, yogurt, and fruits and vegetables, among others, is a great way to kickstart your fueling-up process. If you are in a hurry and can't grab a hearty meal, having a piece of fruit such as a banana or a light snack such as whole grain crackers or a good pre-workout is also a good way to gear up for your workout.
