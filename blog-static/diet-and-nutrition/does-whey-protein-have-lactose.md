# What is Whey Protein Made From?

Whey protein comes from milk. Milk is separated into curds (used to make cheese) and liquid whey during the cheese-making process. This liquid whey is then filtered and dried to create whey protein powder.

# Natural lactose content in whey

Does whey protein have lactose? Since whey comes from milk, it naturally contains lactose, a sugar found in dairy products. How much lactose remains in your whey protein depends on the processing method used, and that’s where the different types of whey come into the picture.

# Does Whey Protein Contain Lactose?

The lactose content in [whey protein](https://www.vpa.com.au/collections/whey-protein) varies depending on the type:

## Whey Protein Concentrate (WPC) – Higher in Lactose

[Whey Protein Concentrate (WPC)](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/premium-whey-wpc) is the least processed form of whey. It typically contains 70–80% protein, with the remaining comprising fats, carbohydrates, and lactose. If you're mildly lactose intolerant, WPC may cause digestive issues like bloating, gas, nausea, or discomfort, especially if consumed in large quantities.

## Whey Protein Isolate (WPI) – Much Lower in Lactose

[Whey Protein Isolate (WPI)](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder) undergoes an additional filtration process that removes most fats and carbohydrates, including lactose. Most WPIs contain 90% or more protein and are often labelled as low-lactose or lactose-free protein powder. If you're wondering if whey isolate is lactose-free, the answer is not always, but it comes very close (typically minuscule).

## Hydrolysed Whey – Pre-Digested, Easier on Digestion

Hydrolysed whey is a protein partially broken down into smaller peptides (pre-digested) to improve absorption and reduce the chance of digestive discomfort. While it still contains a small amount of lactose, it is generally well-tolerated by those with mild sensitivities.

## Important Note: Amounts Vary by Brand

Different brands use different filtration methods. Some whey isolate products claim to be 100% lactose-free, while others may still contain trace amounts. Therefore, individuals with severe intolerance should always check the label and look for third-party tested brands that confirm lactose-free certification.

# Can Lactose-Intolerant People Still Use Whey Protein?

Absolutely – but it depends on the severity of your intolerance.

## Mild vs Severe Lactose Intolerance Explained

People with mild lactose intolerance can often tolerate small amounts of lactose without symptoms. They might do fine with high-quality, low-lactose Whey Protein Isolate (WPI) or even small servings of WPC. Those with severe lactose intolerance or a diagnosed dairy allergy, however, need to be more cautious. Even trace amounts of lactose can trigger symptoms like cramping, bloating, diarrhoea, or nausea.

## Many Lactose-Intolerant Individuals Tolerate Whey Isolate

Because WPI is so low in lactose, it’s often well-tolerated. Many lactose-intolerant athletes and gym-goers use whey isolate regularly without any issues.

## Benefits of Choosing High-Quality, Low-Lactose Options

Brands like VPA Australia offer WPI that is certified lactose-free, ensuring purity and peace of mind. Their filtration techniques remove virtually all lactose, making them one of the best protein powder options for sensitive users. Moreover, they are third-party tested.

# Signs You May Be Sensitive to Lactose in Whey Protein

If you’ve been experiencing digestive discomfort after taking whey, you might be reacting to the lactose in your protein powder. Common signs include:

- Bloating
- Stomach cramps
- Gas
- Diarrhoea
- Nausea within 30 minutes to 2 hours after consumption, sometimes leading to vomiting.

Switching to a lactose-free protein powder or whey isolate can help alleviate these symptoms.

# How to Choose a Whey Protein if You're Lactose Intolerant

Not all whey proteins are the same. Here’s how to shop smart:

## Look for "Whey Isolate" on the label

This is the number one thing to look for. Whey isolate (WPI) has undergone extra processing to remove most lactose. It’s your safest bet if you’re lactose sensitive.

## Check lactose content if available

Some brands list lactose content in grams per serving. Aim for less than 0.5g of lactose per serving, or ideally zero if you are intolerant. Ultimately, how much ...
