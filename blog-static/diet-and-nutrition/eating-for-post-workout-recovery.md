### Why is it important to eat after a workout?

After a workout, whether it is a high-intensity session or not, it is important that we follow the right steps to take care of the body as much as during the actual exercise. Nutritious eating after training helps your body maximise the benefits that are gained from exercise, which means that you are making the most of the exercise you’ve just done – and you can get even stronger and faster just by eating right!

Here we’ve gathered more information on how food can help you recover after a workout and the right kinds of food to eat.

### Protein to restore muscle tissues

Your body’s number one priority after a workout is to replenish energy stores like electrolytes. Made up of amino acids, protein is needed by your body to repair muscle damage. You'll want to consume [20-40 grams of high-quality lean protein](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/benefits-of-whey-protein-isolate) after a workout to maximise protein synthesis, repair muscles and enhance muscle growth. Consuming the right nutrients soon after you exercise can help your body get this done faster.

### Why do you need to eat carbohydrates after an exercise?

Training sessions cause the glycogen stores in your body to be reduced, so your body won't have enough energy to start the recovery process unless you refuel those stores.

Carbohydrates are responsible for providing your body with the right amount of glycogen supply, which is the body's primary source of fuel, so you may want to think again if you're on a low-carb diet - especially if you perform high-intensity workouts more than one day a week.

A post-workout snack or meal that is high in carbohydrates provides energy and gives your muscles time to rebuild. Without this boost, your body will convert fat, followed by protein from the muscle tissues to usable energy, which means that your recovery will take even longer. The takeaway here is that carbohydrates are good for you!

### When and what you should eat after a workout

Exercise causes your body to lose fluids and important vitamins and minerals, especially if you sweat a lot. First, [it’s important to assess and know your nutrient needs based on your level of exercise](https://www.vpa.com.au/pages/vpa-goal-selector) but whole foods are ultimately the best source of nutrition. Regardless of the time of day you exercise, it’s important to eat a healthy snack or meal that contains a combination of protein and carbohydrates.

For fastest recovery, eat within an hour right after finishing your workout. If you can’t grab a snack right away, eat within two hours. Hydrating your body correctly afterwards is also great in order to recover from a workout. Water is a great rehydrating option, and according to the Mayo Clinic, you should be drinking about two or three cups of water for every kilo lost during exercise. Water is often sufficient, but sports drinks containing electrolytes and carbohydrates can help replenish what the body has used up during the workout, especially those lasting over 60 minutes.

High protein snacks like protein balls or protein bars are a great option for post-workout fuel especially if you’re in a hurry, but when you have a bit of extra time it’s better to have a full-on meal instead.
