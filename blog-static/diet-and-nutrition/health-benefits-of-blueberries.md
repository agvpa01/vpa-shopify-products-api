There are nutrient-rich foods that have gained recognition for their exceptional health benefits and the food industry calls them “super foods.” An often over-used marketing term, the term super can be justifiably applied to blueberries. Blueberries are packed with vitamins and minerals that are beneficial for health and disease prevention.   Perhaps the best thing about blueberries is that they are easily added to your breakfast or desserts, giving your usual meals a boost of nutrition power.  

All berries are considered nutritional powerhouses of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and fiber, but among the best of them are blueberries.  Sweet and delicious, they are packed full of antioxidants, potassium, vitamin C and phytoflavinoids (compounds that protect our bodies from stress), and we love them for it! The health benefits of blueberries are further outlined below: 

### What are the health benefits of blueberries? 

- Blueberries help with weight management as they are [low in calories and high in fiber.](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/287710#nutrition)
  
  Blueberries are a great fruit to add to your diet as they are low in calories and high in fiber. They also contain vitamin C, which is an antioxidant that helps fight disease.
  
  Blueberries contain pectin, an insoluble fiber that binds to cholesterol and bile acids in the digestive tract. This can help reduce the amount of fat absorbed from food by up to 10%. Fiber also helps you feel full for longer after eating, so you are less likely to snack on unhealthy foods between meals.
  
  Blueberries are also rich in anthocyanins, flavonoids that give them their blue color. These antioxidants may help prevent cancer and cardiovascular disease as well as slowing down aging.

  Blueberries are packed with antioxidants and phytonutrients that have been linked to reducing your risk of heart disease.

  Blueberry consumption has also been linked to improved blood vessel function, which may help to prevent or slow the progression of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries).

- Blueberries can [reduce risk of cancer.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5187535/)
  
  Blueberries are known as one of the healthiest fruits in the world. They are high in antioxidants, which help fight free radicals and boost overall immunity.
  
  Blueberries can be used to treat various ailments like diabetes, cancer, depression and inflammation.
  
  Blueberries have many health benefits, but one of their most important benefits is that they can reduce your risk of cancer. Blueberries contain the antioxidant anthocyanin which helps reduce the risk of cancer because it prevents damage from being done to your DNA. This also helps decrease inflammation in your body, which can lead to cancer.
  
  Blueberry extract has been shown to be effective against breast cancer cells, prostate cancer cells and colon carcinoma cells. It also reduces lipid peroxidation (the oxidation of lipids) and protects against DNA damage caused by radiation exposure or cigarette smoke exposure.
  
  [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6406748/) show that blueberry extract may help prevent liver diseases caused by alcohol abuse or hepatitis C virus infection by preventing cell death and liver fibrosis (scarring). In addition, blueberry extracts work as a natural treatment for gastric ulcers caused by Helicobacter pylori bacteria infection because they have anti-inflammatory properties and promote healing in damaged tissue.

- [High antioxidant levels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5842687/) from blueberries enhance brain function and help boost memory. 

  Blueberries are one of the most antioxidant-rich fruits. They contain more antioxidants than any other fruit or vegetable. The reason for this is that blueberries are loaded with anthocyanins and flavonols, which are potent antioxidants that can help prevent cellular damage.
  
  Blueberries have been shown to help slow down the aging process, protect against cancer and heart disease, improve vision and boost brain function. Studies have found that blueberries can increase blood flow to the brain, which is important for optimal brain health and memory.
  
  Blueberries' high antioxidant content helps fight free radicals that are known to cause oxidative stress in the body. Free radicals cause cell damage and contribute to inflammation, which can lead to chronic diseases like cancer and heart disease. Antioxidants neutralize free radicals before they can do any damage.

- Blueberries [may lower blood pressure.](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blueberries-may-help-lower-blood-pressure)
  
  Blueberries contain anthocyanin, an antioxidant that may reduce blood pressure by preventing oxidative stress on blood vessel walls.

- Blueberries [act as an anti-inflammatory .](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5842687/)
  
  Blueberries have been studied for their effects on inflammation, particularly in the gut and brain. Studies show that eating blueberries can help reduce markers of inflammation in the body, including C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha).
