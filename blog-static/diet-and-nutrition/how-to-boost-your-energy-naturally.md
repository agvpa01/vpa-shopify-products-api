### It's never fun to arrive at your workout feeling lethargic or low on energy. One must take charge of their health and welfare in order to exert more energy for exercise and increase physical performance and results. What then causes us to feel fatigued?

According to [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7071235/), low energy often occurs because of our food intake. Our energy levels are strongly influenced by factors including the quality and quantity of the food we eat. It's true that we are what we eat, and while going for something sweet, caffeinated, or an energy drink can give us a quick lift, the crash that follows will leave us feeling even worse and more exhausted. So, how do we break the cycle?

Take control of your energy with nutrition and lifestyle changes that you can easily do today!

#### 1. Stock up on energy-boosting foods

Foods provide vitamins, minerals, and fiber that are important to the health of an individual and they are a sustained source of energy.
