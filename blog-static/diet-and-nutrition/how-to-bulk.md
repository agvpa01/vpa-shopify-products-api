# What Is Bulking?

"Bulking," "shredding", and "cutting" are terms often heard in gym circles. Fitness freaks frequently discuss increasing calorie intake to achieve a "beefed-up Arnold Schwarzenegger" body. The question then arises: How to bulk?

If you are trying to bulk up, the key is to consume the right calories with proper exercise. However, busy lifestyles often hinder correct dietary intake, and individuals usually seek any source of extra calories or too many supplements to add muscle, which may be harmful.

## What Is Bulking?

Bulking is a planned and structured approach to increasing muscle mass through consuming a calorie surplus and resistance training.

Cutting vs bulking is a confusing topic in gym circles. Bulking is key for bodybuilding and strength training. It allows the body to gain size and strength, followed by a cutting phase to reduce body fat. Bulking adds lean muscle while minimizing fat gain through proper nutrition, training, rest, and recovery.

There are two primary approaches to bulking:

1. **Lean (Clean) Bulking** – A controlled calorie surplus prioritizing whole, nutrient-rich foods and careful intake of macronutrients and clean supplements to build muscle without excessive fat gain.
2. **Dirty Bulking** – Consuming a large calorie surplus without much concern for food quality (including processed food), often leading to rapid weight gain, including unwanted fat.

### Understanding “how to bulk” is a step-by-step procedure involving the following:

1. Understanding Bulking Nutrition
2. What to eat while bulking?
3. Training for muscle growth while bulking
4. Adjusting your bulk for long-term progress
5. Supplements that support bulking

So, here is a comprehensive list of bulking tips you must understand and follow.

## Step 1 – Understanding Bulking Nutrition

You must consume more calories than your body burns daily to bulk effectively. This calorie surplus provides the energy boost for muscle growth. A general rule is to start with a daily 250–500 calorie surplus and adjust as you progress.

### Macronutrient Breakdown:

- **Protein:** While the body needs 1.5 grams of protein per kilogram to build strength through diet and resistance training, you must aim for at least 1.6–2.2g per kg of body weight to bulk up. Protein sources must include lean meats, fish, dairy, and plant-based options like tofu and lentils.
- **Carbohydrates:** Carbs are usually considered the devil, but they are not. They are the primary energy source for bulking up. Consume complex carbs to fuel workouts and recovery. 40-60% of your total calorie intake should come from carbohydrates.
- **Fats:** Good fats are not the devil, either. They support hormone production, digestion, and overall health. Around 20-30% of total caloric intake should come from healthy fats like avocados, nuts, fatty fish, and olive oil.

### Clean vs Dirty Bulking: Which One is Better?

- **Clean Bulking:** As the name suggests, clean bulking focuses on whole, nutrient-dense foods, controlled calorie intake, and lean muscle gain with minimal fat accumulation. This method fosters sustainable muscle growth and better overall health. A crucial bulking tip? Clean bulking is always the way to go!
- **Dirty Bulking:** Involves consuming excessive calories, often from processed and high-fat foods, leading to rapid weight gain, including fat. While you may gain mass, your metabolic health may suffer, leading to difficult cutting phases.

Most experts recommend clean bulking to maintain a good balance between muscle gain and fat accumulation. This process also makes shredding fat easier.

### How to Build Muscle: Hydration & Digestion for Muscle Growth

Proper hydration supports muscle function, digestion, and nutrient absorption. Most importantly, muscle hydration prevents acid buildup that may lead to cramps. Drinking at least 3–4 liters of water daily is crucial for optimum function and recovery.

Eating fiber-rich foods and probiotics aids digestion and nutrient utilization, clears the stomach to prevent bloating, and ensures efficient muscle growth. Some gut-friendly foods include:

- Greek yogurt
- Fruits, including berries, avocados, apples, and papaya
- Fiber-rich vegetables (broccoli, carrots, spinach)

## Step 2 – What to Eat While Bulking

### Best Protein Sources for Muscle Growth

- **Animal-based:** Chicken breast, turkey, lean beef, eggs, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, fish
- **Plant-based:** Lentils, tofu, quinoa, chickpeas, tempeh

### Best Carbohydrates for Energy & Recovery

- **Complex Carbs:** Brown rice, quinoa, oats, whole wheat bread, legumes
- **Simple Carbs (Post-Workout):** Bananas, white rice, dextrose, honey

### Healthy Fats to Support Hormone Production

- **Monounsaturated fats:** Avocados, olive oil, nuts and seeds
- **Polyunsaturated fats:** Fatty fish (salmon, mackerel), flaxseeds, chia seeds
- **Saturated fats (in moderation):** Coconut oil, full-fat dairy

### Sample Clean Bulking Meal Plan (Including Snacks)

- **Breakfast:** Scrambled eggs with whole-grain toast, avocado, and black coffee
- **Snack:** Greek yogurt with almonds and honey
- **Lunch:** Grilled chicken with quinoa, steamed broccoli, and olive oil dressing
- **Snack:** Creatine monohydrate supplement with banana and peanut butter
- **Dinner:** Salmon with sweet potatoes and roasted asparagus
- **Post-Workout:** [Whey protein isolate (WPI)](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder) with oats ...
