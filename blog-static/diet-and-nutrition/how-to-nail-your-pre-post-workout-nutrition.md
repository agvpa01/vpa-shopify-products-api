## WHY IS PRE & POST WORKOUT NUTRITION IMPORTANT?

We get it. Knowing what to eat and when, can seem a bit confusing. Especially if you’re just getting started with a health and fitness goal. This blog will break down the principles of pre and post training nutrition so you can make the most of your sessions.

### 1. TIMING

**PRE-WORKOUT**

You want to consume some type of meal or snack within 3hrs of training. Depending on when you plan to workout, the size of the meal can change slightly. In short - the sooner you’re training, the smaller and easier to digest you want your meal.

So that might look like one of the following:
- A large meal 2-3hrs prior to training
- A medium/small meal 1-1.5hrs prior to training
- A small energy dense snack <1hr to training

This will allow your food to mostly digest by the time you head to your workout. This is essentially a golden window that ensures you utilize the Calories from your meal, while avoiding feeling lethargic or having any digestion discomfort while training.

**PRO TIP:**
Want to feel extra-ready for your session and get better performance? Consume about 3-6 m of caffeine per kg of bodyweight about 30 minutes prior to your training. The [Gold Coast Stim](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/pre-30-v2-pre-workout) (formerly Pre-30 V.2) is a great option to pick.

### 2. PROTEIN

When it comes to pre and post workout, protein is pretty important! It is the building blocks of your body and is principal to muscle growth and recovery. Having an adequate amount of protein will increase strength, muscle growth, lean body mass, and physical performance. So it’s something you want to keep in mind when planning your meals around your training.

Including around 20–40g of protein both before-and-after your training session is shown to maximally stimulate muscle growth. You want to pick a complete protein - like meat and eggs, or a complete plant-protein like tofu, tempeh or a soy-based protein.

**PRO TIP:**
A protein powder is a really useful and convenient way to get your protein in post-workout. Try a [Premium Plant Protein](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/premium-plant-vegan-protein) or [Whey Protein Isolate](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder).

**POST-WORKOUT**

You should ideally eat your post-workout meal ideally somewhere between 30-90 minutes after training. This will help quickly replenish the glycogen stores in your muscles and encourage optimal muscle protein synthesis to increase recovery, repair, and muscle gain.
