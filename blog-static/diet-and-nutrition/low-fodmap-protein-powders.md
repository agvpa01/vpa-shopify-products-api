### If you’re following a low FODMAP diet you might be wondering about which protein powder is suitable for you and your stomach.
Do you suffer from digestive issues – bloating, gas, cramps, constipation or diarrhoea? Food can be a major irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) trigger. It is usually the FODMAPs – small carbohydrates in certain foods – causing your stomach woes.
FODMAPs are a large group of short chain carbohydrates and sugar alcohols found in all sorts of foods and drinks. These sugars may be poorly absorbed in the small intestine and fermented by bacteria to produce gas. For some people, a diet high in FODMAPs can cause a range of abdominal symptoms. Common symptoms are bloating, excess wind, abdominal pain, constipation or diarrhoea (or a combination). Following a low FODMAP diet can help manage these symptoms – 75% of people with IBS experience relief with a low FODMAP diet.
When you initially cut FODMAPS out of your diet you will need to avoid a large range of foods. High FODMAP foods to avoid include wheat, onions, garlic, milk, yogurt, apples, pears, stone fruits and even cauliflower.

### How do I choose a low FODMAP protein powder?

During the elimination phase and reintroduction phases of the low FODMAP diet it is important to read labels carefully and make sure that any protein powders that you choose do not contain high FODMAP or untested ingredients. It’s also important to avoid other gut irritants so look for a “clean” list of ingredients – choose a product that’s low in sugar and free from fillers, artificial flavours and thickeners.

### Low FODMAP protein powders

- [Whey Protein Isolate](/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder) contains little lactose and is also the purest form of whey protein and very low fat. It is a low FODMAP and also suitable if you are lactose intolerant.
- [Egg Protein Powder](/products/egg-protein) is low FODMAP. Eggs do not contain carbohydrates and therefore do not contain FODMAPs. VPA®’s egg protein powder is 100% egg whites and therefore very low in fat.
- Low FODMAP sweeteners include sugar, dextrose, stevia, sucralose (Splenda) and aspartame. Sucralose is the sweetener chosen for VPA®’s [Whey Protein Isolate](/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder) and [Egg Protein Powder](/products/egg-protein).
