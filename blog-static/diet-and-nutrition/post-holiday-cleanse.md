## 1. Hydrate your body

### Lemon water

Lemons contain ascorbic acid which assists in the cleansing process. To reap its benefits, one must drink it consistently and it only works with fresh lemon juice, not artificial ones. Among its benefits are the following:

- Good source of Vitamin C
- Supports weight loss
- Aids digestion
- May prevent kidney stones

#### Here’s a recipe to try:

- Squeeze half a lemon into 8 ounces of water.
- To further infuse the lemon to your water, you may include the properly washed rinds floating in your drink.
- You may also add mint, ginger, honey, cinnamon, or turmeric to get a healthier boost out of your lemon water drink.
