Over the last couple of years we have seen increase in the number of customers using our products and seeking advice on the best protein powder for after weight loss surgery. To help you out, we have put together this general guide to using protein supplements. Please note that this advice is generalised, and the advice given by your team of health professionals, should be prioritised. That said, a good quality protein powder can be helpful to meet your protein needs after weight loss surgery.

## Protein powders

After weight loss surgery it is important to [consume the right amount of protein](https://www.racgp.org.au/afp/2013/august/the-bariatric-surgery-patient/). This is important in the first few weeks after surgery as well as during your long term diet. When selecting a protein powder the two most important things to consider are the type and amount of protein used. Ideally, you want a supplement made from whey protein isolate with at least 90g protein per 100g. Per serve aim for at least 20g of protein, with less than 3g of carbs and less than 3g of fat.

[VPA®'s WPI](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/whey-protein-isolate-wpi) contains 27g protein per serve and 0.2g of fat and 0.8 grams of carbs and comes in a wide range of flavours sourced from the finest New Zealand grass fed hormone free cattle. Our WPI goes through an ultra-filtration process. This ensures that the protein is in its most natural form, and a high percentage with minimal fats and carbohydrates. Rigorous lab testing ensures that you can expect to receive a complete amino acid profile.

If you’re not after a creamy taste, [VPA®'s protein water](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/protein-water) contains 20g of protein, 0.1g of fat and 1g of carbs per serve. It has the refreshing taste of flavoured water, with the benefits of the highest quality WPI.

## How to use protein powder after weight loss surgery

Make sure you make up your shake with the right amount of water, skim milk, fortified light soy milk or fortified almond milk. Avoid adding too much fruit, fruit juices, full fat milk or nut butters. These ingredients can add a significant amount of calories to your protein shake. Instead try adding spices like cinnamon, ginger or nutmeg or a drop or two of pure vanilla extract to add a burst of flavour.

After surgery your flavour perception may be different. Some flavours can seem more intense that they used. If this is the case try adding a bit more water or skim milk.

Here’s some ideas on how to use your protein powder:
- As a milkshake – make up as per the directions
- add to a cold shot of coffee for a coffee shake
- blend with ice for a frappe
- if you’re having a meal replacement shake like Optifast add ¼ -1/2 scoop to boost protein content
- add ¼ – ½ scoop into plain or vanilla high protein yoghurt and top with berries
- [plain unflavoured WPI](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/whey-protein-isolate-wpi) can be added to soups and casseroles

## Here are three seasons why it's a good idea to use protein powder after weight loss surgery

**Important for muscle repair:**

After weight loss surgery, you need to take protein powder to help repair the muscle tissue. The best time to take protein is when you are exercising because it helps build up your muscles and makes them stronger. Protein helps prevent muscle breakdown and assists in proper healing after surgery, which is important because patients may have difficulty moving around due to their decreased mobility after their operation.

**Protein powder will keep you full and it lasts longer in your system after surgery:**

After weight loss surgery, you may find that you are hungry all the time. Protein powder is a great way to get the nutrients you need without eating a lot of food. Plus, protein powder lasts longer in your system after surgery than other foods, so it will keep you full longer.

**Quick and easy snack:**

Protein powder makes an easy snack that doesn’t require much prep work. If you don’t have time to sit down and eat a full meal, protein powder is a great way to keep your energy levels up while still losing weight.

In conclusion, protein powder can greatly aid weight loss surgery patients in their recovery process. As one of the first steps in recovery from surgery, it is imperative that adequate amounts of protein are consumed to maintain and increase muscle mass. By using protein powder, patients can easily consume a sufficient amount of high quality protein for optimal healing. Protein powder not only aids in the transition to weight loss surgery but also provides a major boost in overall health and wellness.
