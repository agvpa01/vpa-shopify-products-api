### If you’re following a low FODMAP diet you might be wondering about which protein powder is suitable for you and your stomach.
Do you suffer from digestive issues – bloating, gas, cramps, constipation or diarrhoea? Food can be a major irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) trigger. It is usually the FODMAPs – small carbohydrates in certain foods – causing your stomach woes.
FODMAPs are a large group of short chain carbohydrates and sugar alcohols found in all sorts of foods and drinks. These sugars may be poorly absorbed in the small intestine and fermented by bacteria to produce gas. For some people, a diet high in FODMAPs can cause a range of abdominal symptoms. Common symptoms are bloating, excess wind, abdominal pain, constipation or diarrhoea (or a combination). Following a low FODMAP diet can help manage these symptoms – 75% of people with IBS experience relief with a low FODMAP diet.
When you initially cut FODMAPS out of your diet you will need to avoid a large range of foods. High FODMAP foods to avoid include wheat, onions, garlic, milk, yogurt, apples, pears, stone fruits and even cauliflower. [The Monash Uni FODMAP app is a powerful tool to help you find low FODMAP food.](https://www.monashfodmap.com/ibs-central/i-have-ibs/get-the-app/)

---

### How do I choose a low FODMAP protein powder?

During the elimination phase and reintroduction phases of the low FODMAP diet it is important to read labels carefully and make sure that any protein powders that you choose do not contain high FODMAP or untested ingredients. It’s also important to avoid other gut irritants so look for a “clean” list of ingredients – choose a product that’s low in sugar and free from fillers, artificial flavours and thickeners.

---

### Low FODMAP protein powders

- [Whey Protein Isolate](/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder) contains little lactose and is also the purest form of whey protein and very low fat. It is a low FODMAP and also suitable if you are lactose intolerant.
- [Egg Protein Powder](/products/egg-protein) is low FODMAP. Eggs do not contain carbohydrates and therefore do not contain FODMAPs. VPA®’s egg protein powder is 100% egg whites and therefore very low in fat.
- Low FODMAP sweeteners include sugar, dextrose, stevia, sucralose (Splenda) and aspartame. Sucralose is the sweetener chosen for VPA®’s [Whey Protein Isolate](/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder) and [Egg Protein Powder](/products/egg-protein).

### What is Vitamin D?

Here is your guide to the Sunshine Vitamin – Vitamin D. Most of us have heard of Vitamin D and know that it comes from sunlight, hence the name the Sunshine Vitamin. Now that we are coming into the cooler months and are spending more time indoors, how do we get the levels of Vitamin D we need to stay healthy?

---

### Vitamin D

Vitamin D otherwise known as the ‘Sunshine Vitamin’ isn’t actually vitamin, it’s a hormone. Put simply the body can synthesise Vitamin D, with help from sunlight, from a precursor the body makes from cholesterol.

---

### Benefits of Vitamin D

- It is well known for its ability to aid the absorption of calcium in the body which is important for bone growth and development.
- Plays an important role in facilitating normal immune system function.
- It can aid in [optimal muscle function](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3497950/) by reducing inflammation, pain and myopathy.
- [Assists in regulating insulin levels](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/the-benefits-of-resistance-training-for-glucose-metabolism) and aids in the management of type 2 diabetes.
- Reducing the risk for many [chronic diseases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3427198/) such as autoimmune disease, heart disease, cancers and infectious diseases.

---

### Sources of Vitamin D

The main source of the sunshine vitamin is exposure to sunlight. The Sunshine Vitamin is not found naturally in many foods; it is added to some products and is available as a dietary supplement. Meaning food alone cannot provide most people with necessary levels of this vitamin. However, consumption of certain foods can help increase vitamin levels in the body.

Foods that contain Vitamin D include:
- Eggs
- Fatty fish
- Mushrooms (hint leave the mushrooms in the sun for 2-3 hours (gill side up) before cooking to get the most benefit you can!)
- Fortified foods, such as margarine and milk
- Supplements, such as VPA®'s own [Multi Greens](/products/multi-greens)

---

### How much sunlight do I need?

Sunlight accounts for more than 80% of the Sunshine Vitamin in our body. There is no easy answer to this question as it depends on a number of factors including where you live, season, time of day, your skin colour and the amount of skin exposed to the sun.

Generally speaking in the cooler times of year you need more sun exposure as only your arms, hands and possibly your face are exposed to the sun.

As you can see it is quite simple to still get our Vitamin D levels up to ensure we stay healthy during winter.

**SEO Title:** Five Keto Supplements that can improve your performance

**SEO Description:** Some supplements can help make the keto diet easier. They can reduce the “keto flu”, enhance athletic performance and allow you to thrive.

### Are you following a keto diet? Some keto supplements can help make the transition to this way of eating much easier. They can reduce the “keto flu”, commonly experienced while following this high-fat, low-carb eating plan. Other supplements can enhance athletic performance and allow you to thrive on this style of eating. It goes without saying that all of these supplements have no, or almost no, carbohydrates so are perfectly suited to a keto diet.

---

### Five of the best keto supplements:

---

### 1. Electrolytes

The first few weeks on a keto diet can be tough as the body adapts to the very low number of carbs consumed. Increased water loss means that levels of sodium, potassium and magnesium can drop. Headaches, muscles cramps and fatigue are symptomic of “keto flu”. [Athletes following a keto diet may experience even greater fluid and electrolyte losses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5371639/) through sweating.

If you are following a keto diet it is important to focusing on adding minerals through diet. Increase your intake of potassium and magnesium rich foods such as dark leafy greens, nuts, avocados and seeds. You might need to add some extra salt to your food too. Adding in an electrolyte keto supplement [which contains containing sodium, potassium and magnesium can help replenish your body after intense exercise.](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/electrolyte-capsules)

Keto diets often cause an imbalance in electrolyte levels because most people don't drink enough water when they start the diet. That's why it's important to take supplements containing electrolytes if you're on a keto diet.

Here are five reasons why you should consider adding electrolytes to your keto lifestyle:

1) It helps you maintain energy levels throughout the day

2) It increases endurance during workouts and helps repair muscles after exercise

3) It reduces feelings of fatigue and brain fog associated with low-carb diets

4) It improves cognitive function and mental clarity (especially during periods of high stress)

5) Electrolyte supplementation can improve certain conditions like asthma, diabetes, kidney disease, heart disease and liver disease

---

### 2. Creatine

[Creatine](/products/creatine-monohydrate) is a well researched and evidence backed supplement. It increases the rate at which energy is produced and used in the body. Choosing creatine as a keto supplement helps you work harder and work longer by helping to replenish our energy systems. This increases peak power output, and this in turn has and this has several positive impacts on sports performance and body composition.

Here are four reasons to consider adding creatine to your keto lifestyle:

1. Creatine helps you build muscle faster when carb intake is low

2. It can help maintain muscle mass during periods of fat loss

3. It improves athletic performance by increasing strength and endurance

4. It can boost brain function and reduce mental fatigue

---

### 3. Caffeine

[An extra cup of coffee or green tea](https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/ijsnem/6/1/article-p14.xml) can benefit athletic performance and boost energy levels and is a delicious keto supplement! This is especially so for athletes starting out on a keto diet. You could also take caffeine in the form of a pre-workout supplement. Our [Venom® pre-workout](/products/venom-pre-workout) has the equivalent caffeine of three espresso shots as well as several over performance boosting ingredients.

Here are 5 reasons to consider adding caffeine to your keto lifestyle:

1. Caffeine can help you burn more fat.

2. Caffeine can help you build more muscle.

3. Caffeine can boost your brain power and focus.

4. Caffeine can improve athletic performance and endurance training.

5. Caffeine can help stave off hunger pangs (especially during the evening hours).

### What is Intermittent Fasting?

The latest trend and word on the street is intermittent fasting (IF), but what is Intermittent Fasting? Intermittent fasting is an eating pattern that cycles between periods of fasting and feasting. There is still a focus on eating healthy foods, but the main focus is when to eat them. IF is not a diet and there is no focus on restricting food groups – however reduced caloric intake may result.

This method dates back to the hunter and gatherer lifestyles, where humans fasted due to the non-availability of food – yet we still survived! The IF practice is also common in religious practices also – such as the Muslims during Ramadan.

---

### How Does Intermittent Fasting Work?

The typical eating and fasting phase of an IF diet look like 8 hours of eating and 16 hours of fasting, but some others choose a more extreme version with a smaller eating window.

- Eating Phase of an 8-hour window, for example, 12 pm – 8 pm
- Fasting Phase of a 16-hour window, 8 pm - 12 midday

During the fasting periods, you eat either very little or nothing at all. For best results, it is recommended to stick to the basic fluids of water, green tea, black tea, and black coffee.

---

### Why Intermittent Fasting

1. Insulin sensitivity improves and levels of insulin drop dramatically. Lower insulin levels make stored body fat more accessible, encouraging the body to burn more fat stores. It also helps regulate the body’s insulin sensitivity and hormone regulation.
2. Intermittent fasting increases the release of the fat-burning hormone norepinephrine (noradrenaline).
3. Over time after eating during the 8-hour window, you will start to get fuller quicker. By eating fewer meals, intermittent fasting can lead to an automatic reduction in calorie intake without an actual focus and purpose of calorie restriction.

---

4. Some studies show a reduction in body inflammation, a key driver of many chronic diseases.
5. Heart Health: Intermittent fasting may reduce LDL cholesterol, blood triglycerides, inflammatory markers, blood sugar, and insulin resistance.
6. Brain Health: Intermittent fasting increases a brain hormone called Brain-derived neurotrophic factor which aids the growth of new nerve cells.
7. I feel a major benefit of intermittent fasting is that it makes healthy eating simpler. There are fewer meals to prep, cook, and clean up after.

**NOTE:** Intermittent Fasting is NOT suitable for everyone. Please consult with your health care practitioner if intermittent fasting is suitable for you, especially if you are diabetic or pregnant. Intermittent fasting alone is not recommended for weight loss. A healthy diet and active lifestyle are recommended. Results may vary. Individuals who are underweight or have a history of eating disorders should not fast. There is also some evidence that intermittent fasting may be harmful for some women.

## What is a diet break?

If you’ve ever been on a weight loss journey, you know that it can be a difficult journey at times. Whether you’ve been working towards reaching a healthy weight range, leaning out for a body building competition, or even making weight for a sports competition, your are probably no stranger to the dreaded weight plateau. Plateaus can be frustrating. You feel like you are doing all of the right things, but the number on the scales just wont shift! It turns out that avoiding continuous dieting may be the key to losing weight and keeping the kilos off. Learn about how a diet break can help you lose weight.

## How can a diet break help weight loss?

A diet break can take one of two forms. For body builders or those dropping weight temporarily to make weight for a competition, it may take the form of a cheat meal or a single day per week with a higher calorie intake. For those on a longer and more significant weight loss journey, a diet break might be a period of a week or two where you raise your calorie intake.

The School of Health Sciences researchers revealed that taking a two-week break during dieting may improve weight loss. The study, funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia, looked at the body’s natural ‘famine reaction’ to prolonged dieting and how it effected weight loss for men.

Data to come out of recent study by a team at the University of Tasmania showed that a two-week break during dieting may improve weight loss. The study looked at the body’s metabolic adaptation to prolonged dieting and how it effected weight loss in men.

The study consisted of two groups, both took part in a 16-week diet which cut calorie intake by one third. One group maintained the diet continuously for 16 weeks straight. The second group dieted for two weeks, then broke from the diet for two weeks. During the ‘diet break’ they ate as much as needed to keep their weight stable. They repeated this cycle for 30 weeks in total to ensure 16 weeks of dieting.

Those in the diet break group lost more weight and also gained less weight after the trial finished. On they lost 8 kg more than the continuous diet group, six months after the end of the diet.

Head of UTAS of Health Sciences, Professor Nuala Byrne said dieting altered a series of biological processes in the body. This leads to slower weight loss, and possibly weight gain.

“When we reduce our energy (food) intake during dieting, resting metabolism decreases to a greater extent than expected; a phenomenon termed ‘adaptive thermogenesis’ — making weight loss harder to achieve”
- Professor Nuala Byrne

This adaptation is a survival mechanism which helped humans to survive as a species when food supply was inconsistent in millennia past. However it us now contributing to our growing waistlines when the food supply is readily available.

There is a growing body of research which has shown that diets which use one to seven day periods of complete or partial fasting alternated with ad libitum food intake, are not more effective for weight loss than conventional continuous dieting.

If you would like to check out the study for yourself [you can find it here.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28925405/)

## Do Supplements Help You Lose Weight?

Certain supplements can boost your metabolism by increasing the amount of energy that your body burns each day. This means that even when you're not working out or doing anything active, your body will burn more calories than usual — [helping you burn fat faster and lose weight!](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/the-top-5-protein-powders-for-weight-loss?_pos=6&_sid=5fd02c6e2&_ss=r)

They also help you not feel hungry as often or crave unhealthy snacks as much — which means less sugar cravings!

But before you drinking them, make sure you check with a doctor first. Some supplements, especially if you opt for the pill type, may interact negatively with medications or other health conditions, so it's important to know what's safe before taking them on your own.

**Summary:** Amount and types of protein for endurance athletes

When it comes to fuelling and recovery for endurance sports, the importance of protein is undervalued. A recent study has shown that long-standing protein recommendations were underestimating the importance of protein for endurance athletes. If you are a runner, a triathlete, or an endurance swimmer, you need to eat enough protein.

So what is protein and why do you need it? As a macronutrient, protein performs structural and functional roles within the body. It also serves as a minor fuel source during endurance exercise. Protein is needed for the repair of muscles and connective tissues, including ligaments and tendons. These tissues are subject to damage and breakdown through their repetitive and sustained use during endurance training. Trail running may increase protein requirements even further. This is due to the extra damage caused by the body tackling challenging downhill and uphill courses. We don’t need to tell you about the extra impact this has on joints and the additional muscle recruitment required! As a fuel source, it is estimated that protein can contribute between 5-10% of energy used while running. This further contributes to the increased protein needs of endurance athletes.

---

## How much protein do endurance athletes need?

Previous protein recommendations for endurance athletes were based on nitrogen balance studies. Based on these studies, protein recommendations were given as 1.6g/kg body weight per day for elite athletes, and as little as 0.8-1g/kg body weight per day for recreational endurance athletes. This is only slightly above the recommendations for sedentary individuals at only 0.7g/kg of body weight per day. However, a 2015 study found that even recreational endurance athletes require at least 1.65g of protein per kg of body weight per day. This level of protein intake will optimize your recovery and reduce chances of injury. In return, this will support ongoing participation in your sport and reduce lengthy downtime due to injury.

## How can I eat enough protein?

If you are an endurance athlete, the amount of time you spend training can create significant challenges when it comes to your nutrition. Studies indicate that 10-20% of endurance athletes are not meeting their daily protein requirements. While no one disputes that consuming fresh food is optimal, it is not always possible or convenient. For this reason, athletes might benefit from high-quality protein supplements such as [Whey Protein Isolate](/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder). For those who find it difficult to eat enough food at all, combined protein-carbohydrate supplements such as a [Muscle Gainer](/products/muscle-gainer) could help with this.

---

## What are the best proteins for recovery?

Recovery from endurance training or events involves rehydration, refueling, and repair of tissues. Recovery is optimized by consuming protein in combination with carbohydrate within one hour of training or your event. This combination of macronutrients increases the rate at which muscles are repaired. An insulin spike stimulates muscle tissue to uptake amino acids at a faster rate. Ingested carbohydrate begins the refueling process by replenishing glycogen stores.

For the time-poor athlete, [whey protein isolate](/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder) added to skim milk provides a combination of protein, carbohydrate, electrolytes, and water. These are essential for recovery nutrition. Containing both leucine and carbohydrate, this will stimulate rapid uptake of amino acids and begin the rapid repair of muscles. For those with no access to milk or who have to avoid milk due to intolerances, try a [Muscle Gainer](/products/muscle-gainer) made on water – it will provide the protein and carbohydrate you need to kick start your recovery.

The ability of your muscles to repair is heightened for 24 hours after you finish a significant training session or event, so ensuring that you are maintaining a protein intake of at least 1.6kg of protein per kg of body weight over the next day will assist in the repair of your body. A protein supplement can help you meet this protein intake easily.

### Drink your coffee plain

Research published in the journal *Public Health* show people who drink black coffee instead of adding milk, sugar or syrups consume on average 69 fewer calories per day. However, if you are a coffee addict, this difference could be much higher! If black coffee isn't for you, switch reduced fat milk which will also help lower the energy content of your coffee. Remember that coffee can actually help reduce calories by acting as a natural appetite suppressant.

The flavour of coffee itself is strong enough that you won't even miss all those extra calories from dairy products and sweeteners. If you want even more flavour boost in your cup, try adding some spices like cinnamon or nutmeg for an added kick!

### Get more fibre early in the day

Research published in the *Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism* revealed that people who had oats for breakfast consumed 31% fewer calories over the course of the rest of the day. Choosing a high fibre breakfast helps you feel full, and also puts you in the right frame of mind to carry on eating well for the rest of the day.

### Swap soft drink for carbonated water

If you only cut out 1 can of soft drink a day you will save about 150 calories. “My favorite tip for cutting back on soda is to switch to sparkling water,” says Kristi King. “You can add fruit or even a little sweetener if you want some extra flavor, but even then you’ll be cutting way back on the sugar in soda.” If soda water isn't for you, make the switch to sugar free and still experience the calorie reduction.

Cutting out soft drinks can save you hundreds of calories a day and reduce your risk of heart disease, diabetes and obesity. But you don't have to ban them altogether. Swap them for sparkling water and add natural fruit flavours like orange or lemon to improve the taste.

### Eat more protein

Ideas for high fibre breakfasts include:
1. Baked beans and eggs on multigrain toast.
2. Rolled oats served with yogurt and berries.
3. VPA® Vanilla breakfast shake with added berries

### We all know what it feels like after we eat junk food…to summarise, you feel like you are operating at 20% of your normal mental and physical capacity. Well, this sensation may be more serious than a food coma after a cheat meal.

The *International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition published* a study by Professor Jim E. Banta, PhD, MPH found adults who consumed regular junk food were more likely to have symptoms of moderate or severe psychological distress when compared to similar adults who consumed a healthier diet, regardless of characteristics such as gender, education, age, marital status and income.

Professor Banta stated that these findings are consistent with previous studies that have found a link between mental illness and unhealthy food choices. Interestingly they have found the foods that are linked to bipolar and to depression:

---

## Bipolar: Sugar

---

### Depression: Fried food, processed grains and sugar

---

“Perhaps the time has come for us to take a closer look at the role of diet in mental health, because it could be that healthy diet choices contribute to mental health,” Banta said. Banta did state that this link cannot be confirmed as causal, as more research needs to be conducted, but he emphasised the importance that this finding and similar findings may have for behavioural medicine treatments.

Over 240,000 telephone surveys were conducted for this study by the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS). The study revealed that nearly 17% of California adults are likely to suffer from mental illness — 13.2% with moderate psychological distress and 3.7% with severe psychological distress. This is a huge number of people who are suffering every day from what may be easily treatable with some small diet changes.

So next time you reach for the soda or go through the drive-through after a long day, think about your brain and make a healthier choice.

### Is Leaky Gut Syndrome Real?

Leaky gut syndrome is defined as a reduce barrier to the passage of molecules from the intestine into the wall of the intestine and from there, possibly into the body.

The human digestive tract is where food is broken down and nutrients are absorbed. But did you know that the digestive system also plays an important role in protecting the body from harmful substances. The walls of the intestine act as barrier, controlling what enters the bloodstream. When we talk about intestinal permeability we are referring to how easily a substance can pass through the intestinal wall.

### Possible Causes of Leaky Gut

A possible cause of leaky gut is increased intestinal permeability or intestinal hyperpermeability. Hyperpermeability simply means the intestinal lining has become more porous, with more holes developing that are larger in size and the screening process is no longer functioning appropriately. This can potentially lead to substances being “leaked” into the bloodstream. It is when these tight junctions of the intestinal wall become loose, that the gut becomes more permeable, which may allow bacteria and toxins to pass from the gut into the blood stream. When the gut becomes “leaky” and these bacteria and toxins have entered the bloodstream, it can cause extensive inflammation possibly resulting in an immune system trigger reaction.

The causes of leaky gut remain a medical mystery. The medical professions are still trying to determine exactly what causes it. Nevertheless, medical professionals do agree that increased intestinal permeability or intestinal hyperpermeability exists.

### Studies have connected increased intestinal hyperpermeability with multiple chronic diseases such as:

- Celiac disease
- Crohn’s disease
- Diabetes
- Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
- Food allergies

The gut is considered the second brain known as the enteric nervous system. The brain in the gut has a mind of its own that guides our feelings, moods, certain behaviors and reactions and plays a major role in our happiness and misery. When the gut is inflamed, infected with pathogens, not functioning optimally or the gut is leaky production of serotonin and other neurotransmitters will be impaired leading to neurological manifestations because the gut has lost the ability to effectively absorb nutrients or convert them into vital brain chemicals.

Leaky gut affects the whole body including the brain. The brain communicates with the gut via the enteric nervous system. When there is a communication difficulty from the gut to the brain or from the brain to the gut, health is compromised!

### Factors that could potentially play a role in leaky gut are:

- Excessive sugar intake
- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
- Excessive alcohol intake
- Nutrient deficiencies
- Stress
- Inflammation
- Lack of zinc
- Poor gut health
- Yeast overgrowth
- Hormonal deficiencies

Methods of improving gut health include removing inflammatory substances that irritate and damage the gut. Consuming fermented foods, high fiber foods, including probiotic and prebiotic food sources, eating nutrient-dense foods, drink plenty of water. Minimizing stress is crucial in gut restoration.

If you feel you have leaky gut the key to addressing it is finding the underlying causes and prioritizing a healthy gut as a lifestyle change. Consult your medical health practitioner. In my practice I conduct a comprehensive digestive stool analysis testing which provides an extensive look at the health and function of your gut. Book a consultation to get your stool kit.

### How to Stop Food Cravings for good?

How to Stop Food Cravings?

- Eating regularly (every 3 hours) is key to avoiding a dip in blood sugar levels and in turn having cravings for food with little to no nutritional value.

  Eating healthy fats can also help with cravings. Healthy fats are good for you, but they also help suppress your appetite because they keep you full longer than other types of food.
  
  If you find yourself craving junk food, try to indulge in a healthy version instead. For example, if you crave chocolate, make your own chocolate bar using raw cacao powder, coconut oil, dates and nuts. It’s much healthier than consuming processed chocolate from a shop!

- Eating smaller meals more often will stop you going into starvation mode which causes a change in neurotransmitters and hormones.

  When you're hungry, your brain sends signals to your stomach, telling it to produce ghrelin (the hormone that makes you hungry). When you're full, the opposite happens — your brain sends signals to stop producing ghrelin.
  
  Studies have shown that frequent eating can help lower blood sugar levels and reduce cravings for high-carbohydrate foods. So if you're trying to cut back on sweets or other junk food, don't skip meals; instead, eat small meals every two hours or so throughout the day.
  
  Eating breakfast helps control cravings for sugary snacks later in the day. Research shows that people who skip breakfast are more likely to overeat later in the day than those who eat breakfast regularly — especially high-carbohydrate foods like pastries and doughnuts.

- Prioritize nutrient-rich foods like nuts or substitute your chocolate fix for a sugar-free chocolate protein bar.

- Enforcing regular meals and snacks comprising of complex carbohydrate and protein will help to stabilize blood sugar levels.

- Retrain your brain by having a period of abstinence from sugar and simple carbohydrates. Break the circuit!

  If you want to break the cycle of food cravings, there are several things you can do to retrain your brain. The first is to have a period of abstinence from sugar and simple carbohydrates. This means that for about two weeks, you cut out all sweets, soda pop, fruit juices and other foods high in these types of carbohydrates. The idea is that after a while, when you start eating these foods again they won't taste as good as they used to because they'll be associated with cravings and discomfort rather than pleasure.

- Plan your meals for the week so that you have nutritious meals and snacks on hand.

  It takes some planning, but it’s worth it. When you know what you’re having for dinner and have the ingredients on hand, you’re less likely to reach for something unhealthy when a craving hits.

Using a [tasty whey protein](https://www.vpa.com.au/collections/best-sellers) can help to achieve some of the above points (eat every 3 hours, eat smaller meals, prioritize nutrient-rich foods, regular snacks with protein, replace sugar with sweet protein shakes etc).

**Shop our 14+ flavours**

Having a well-balanced diet including protein, complex carbohydrates, vegetables and grains will keep you feeling fuller for longer. Snacking on foods like nuts and berries will also provide other nutrient-rich alternatives to chocolate and sugary foods. Balance is all about eating well, but also being able to treat yourself without binging. We hope this has answered your question of “How to Stop Food Cravings for good?”

### Does eating before bed make you gain weight? Can eating before bed ruin your diet?

There are two answers, yes and no (nothing is simple!)

There are long term myths and beliefs that because you are not active during sleep, all the calories consumed prior bedtime will all be stored as fat. This is not entirely correct, but it does leave a lot of people asking “Does eating before bed make you gain weight?” Late night binge eating and calorie snacking before bed after dinner will most likely make you gain weight – because of the extra calories consumed over the last 24 hours.

1. It is all about calories in and calories out (for most people). Ensure you eat the recommended calories for your age, height and weight ([https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/eat-health-calculators](https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/eat-health-calculators)). Eating above the calorie recommendation and not creating a deficit through body movement, will increase weight.
2. If you are a shift worker, or work unusual hours (like a personal trainer) if your last meal is 830pm, eat it! The best type of food to eat for dinner at this time of night are those low in starch and low in sugar. Reducing these foods promotes higher levels of anti-ageing, immunity boosting, fat burning and muscle building hormones!

---

## So why do I gain weight then?

The main culprit for any type of weight gain, as a general rule of thumb, is eating more than what your body needs. If you are after steady weight loss, 0.5kg is a weekly energy/calorie expenditure of 3500 calories; an average of a daily 500 calorie deficit.

Exercise should become second nature and a necessity during everyday life for personal well being. More activity in the day will help create a deficit, such as walking for an extra 5-10 minutes, washing the car by hand, mowing the lawns, hanging out the laundry. Every little bit helps if you have no time to allocate to exercise or do not like going to the gym/have access to it.

Calories start to quickly add up (and sneakily if you are not armed with proper information) include consuming:

1. Sport drinks when you have not worked out intensely enough to need it (think marathon runners and endurance sports) 155 calories/500ml!
2. Fizzy drinks 142 calories/330ml!
3. Teaspoon of sugar in each coffee/tea 20 calories/teaspoon!
4. Small Thick Shake from McDonalds 461 calories!
5. 50 grams of raw almonds 299 calories!

Using the above information, it quickly adds up – 1400 calories in a day is somewhat less exciting once all of the above-mentioned foods are included in the day!

---

## So, Does eating before bed make you gain weight?

In summary, the body does not know what time you ate, there are better times to eat, but at the end of the day, total calories consumed over a 24 hour period is just that. Just lay off starchy and sugars before bedtime (you will sleep better for it!).

## Content

Nutrition has gone through many cycles in the past 50 years and from these cycles have been some pretty elaborate myths. Below are the Top 5 Nutrition Myths that have been introduced into society and have been proven incorrect.

## Nutrition Myth Number 1 – Eat low fat, high carbohydrate diets to stay healthy

The number one Top 5 Nutrition Myth came about back in the 1980’s when fat was considered the main reason for cardiovascular disease. There was a massive push on reducing fat intake because of the unhealthy side effects it has on the body. Carbohydrates are the body’s preferred fuel source and back in the 1980’s there were a couple of major studies (yes, two) that came out, identifying fat as the single most important change that needed to be made in order to improve diet and health. Mostly to blame was saturated fat. The idea back then to improve health was to reduce saturated fat. However when the fat is taken out of a food, it needs to be replaced with something so carbohydrates became fashionable and the term “low fat” automatically meant it was a “healthier option”. Fast forward now, we know that this can partly be blamed as the reason for our obesity epidemic.

## Nutrition Myth Number 2 – Egg yolks are bad for you

Again, when fat was considered bad for you; all fats unfortunately got tarnished with the same brush including egg yolks. The claim was that as egg yolks are high in cholesterol that they are bad for you. However, studies found that dietary cholesterol has very little impact on blood cholesterol and more so the consumption of saturated and trans fats are what should be avoided. It is these fats that raise LDL (unhealthy cholesterol). Egg yolks are also an excellent source of protein, vitamins B12 & D, riboflavin and folate. For those restricting calories for weight division contests such as boxing, MMA etc or competing on stage in physique competitions, these people may benefit from omitting egg yolks due to the additional calories they pack.

## Nutrition Myth Number 3 – Wholemeal / wholegrain bread is a healthier choice

Bread today regardless of if it is made with white or wholegrain flour is processed within an inch of its life and store bought bread – regardless of the type offers very little nutritional value to the diet – pretty much empty calories. Some have added vitamins but not all. Grains are not necessarily a healthy option either – excess consumption refined grains have been shown in some studies to increase markers of inflammation. Breads that offer some nutrition – sourdough does contain the probiotic lactobacillus and Ezekiel which has no added sugar, more fibre and contains a number of vitamins you won’t find in traditional store bought bread.

## Nutrition Myth Number 4 – Coffee is bad for you

Well it can be if you load it up with full fat milk and sugar and smash down several per day. Black coffee on the other hand is loaded with antioxidants and regular coffee drinkers have been shown to have lower chances of developing depression, type 2 diabetes and Parkinson’s disease.

## Nutrition Myth Number 5 – High protein diets are bad for your kidneys

The final Top 5 Nutrition Myth is a big one and is frustrating for all of us who know the importance of protein! In healthy people, there has yet to be any studies that conclude this as correct. Higher protein diets have been shown in numerous clinical studies to improve body composition, increase satiety and lower blood pressure. Protein also is the most metabolically active tissue and is used for a number of functions from muscle repair and growth, regeneration of all cells. Protein is the fuel also what drives all immune function and in particular whey protein which contains glutathione – a powerful antioxidant which helps to maintain glutamine levels. Healthy glutamine levels are essential for maintaining immune function. With winter not far off, it would be wise to include whey protein as part of your diet to enhance your immune defence.

### How much do I eat to gain muscle or to lose body fat?

How much do I eat to gain muscle or to lose body fat? Or what diet should I use to lose body fat and gain muscle? These are the questions everybody asks when they decide to commit to a body transformation, and there is a lot of info out there which can make it very confusing. From the start of our journey to the every day gym session, we all have goals in mind. For most of us we want to get stronger, lose body fat and gain muscle. Working out is most certainly a fundamental piece of the puzzle when we want to reach any of these goals, but without the right nutritional approach you could find yourself getting nowhere fast.

### How much do I eat to gain muscle or to lose body fat is a question which doesn’t really have a perfect answer – it depends on a lot of different factors.

It depends on how many calories you burn at rest, through training and how active of a job you have. This is all part of an equation based on your height, weight, age and gender. This is found out using the Harris Benedict Activity Formula.

Let’s try not to complicate this process for you.

First up, you need to find out your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). Your BMR is basically the amount of calories (energy) your body would need each day to stay alive, keep your heart pumping and your organs functioning. If you sat down all day, this is roughly the amount you would need to maintain weight.

Calculate your BMR here: [http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/](http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/)

**Let’s use one of our staff members as an example: He is a 26-year-old male, 6ft (180cm) tall and weighs 225 pounds (102kg). After using the calculator, he finds his BMR is 2205.35**

The next step we take is factoring in our activity through exercise and through our job. This is taken from the following table:

Reference: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris–Benedict_equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris–Benedict_equation)

**His BMR is 2205.35 and he trains 5 times per week and doesn’t have an extremely active job. This gives him the result of 2205.35 x 1.55 = 3,418.3**

**If he were to have a labouring job, for example, or be constantly walking all day at work, then he might fall into the next category of 1.725.**

**So after adding in activity levels, he will maintain weight at roughly 3,400 calories per day.**

Our next step is to figure out whether we want to lose body fat or gain muscle.

The general guide is to put yourself 300-500 calories either side of this number which would either put you into a calorie surplus or deficit. Generally speaking, going further than 500 calories either side would either risk loss of muscle whilst in a deficit or risk the gain of excess fat whilst in a surplus.

**If our staff member wanted to lose some body fat he would eat 2,900 – 3,100 calories per day.**

**If he wanted to gain muscle he would eat 3,700 – 3,900 calories per day.**

But you have to remember, this is a guide. You will never pin point your exact energy needs for every single day, but this is a very good start. Monitor your progress, whether it be scales, callipers or photos each week. If you’re gaining too fast and putting on a little too much body fat, you probably need to lower your calories slightly. If you’re not gaining weight or muscle, then bring your calories up slightly. Same goes with fat loss. If you’re not losing weight, you probably need to lower calories slightly. If you’re losing too much weight too fast, bring your calories up slightly.

**For example:**

**In a fat loss phase he would eat 6 meals in a day, at 500 calories per meal.**

**In a muscle building phase he would eat 6 meals in a day, at 650 calories per meal.**

Many people have a difficult time losing fat and preserving their muscle mass. However, following these healthy diet and exercise guidelines will help you realize your weight loss goals while maintaining the musculature that you've worked so hard to build.

In either phase he would incorporate a balance between meat, vegetables, complex carbohydrates, good fats and supplements like [whey protein](/collections/protein-powder) and intra workout carbs [BCAA’s](/products/bcaa-7000) for maximum recovery and gym performance.

Use this as a guide to lose body fat and gain muscle and hopefully it will help you to reach those body composition goals that you’re after.

### "Suns out guns out".

That’s the mantra that most of us go by, but if you want to be able to get your whole birthday suit out all year round, here are 3 key points for how to lose FAT and gain MUSCLE.

Before we talk about the three key points, let’s cover some basic terminology so we ground the conversation. To lose fat and gain muscle isn’t easy, but can be done. More commonly, however, gym conversations centre around bulking and cutting.

---

#### Bulking and Cutting

If you’re a regular to the gym or participate in any weight training-based sports such as bodybuilding or powerlifting then chances are, if you haven’t done so yourself, you’ve heard of people bulking or cutting. Bulking refers to the process of eating in a calorie surplus and lifting weights with the goal of increasing your muscle mass. For many people on a bulk, a degree of fat gain also occurs. A cut refers to the process of eating in a calorie deficit, with the goal of decreasing fat mass, to reveal the muscles below that have resulted from the hard work you put in during your bulk.

---

#### Body recomposition is how to lose fat and gain muscle

Building muscle while decreasing fat mass, otherwise known as body recomposition, is possible although it does require a good amount of nutritional and exercise knowledge. Recomposition is easier to achieve if you are untrained or have a higher body fat percentage, but it can be achieved by anyone with the right know-how and importantly, self-discipline.

Simon Stockton, is the owner of Ironclad Fitness based in Brisbane and is an expert in body recomposition. He explains the three most important things you need to do lose fat while gaining muscle.

---

#### The three best ways to achieve body decomposition:

1. Maintain a calorie deficit.

Eat at a slight calorie deficit in order to draw energy from your fat tissue and become leaner. Those with a higher body fat percentage and achieve recomposition with a more aggressive deficit. The leaner you are to begin with, the smaller your calorie deficit can be, as you have less fat to burn. The leaner you are, the better knowledge of nutrition either you or your coach need to have, and the more disciplined you need to be.

Think practically. If your body wants to build and repair, it needs energy to increase muscle mass. If you want to reduce your body fat, your body must burn more calories than your intake. The balance you need to strike on these two fronts is real. Too high a calorie deficit and your body will metabolize muscle to make up the difference if your calorie intake is too low.

2. Have a high protein intake.

Keep protein intake high – Consume least 1.7g / kg of body weight per day, and up to 2.4g per kg of body weight if you are very lean. A high protein intake will help you maintain, if not build muscle mass, when you are in calorie deficit. High protein intake will ensure that your consumed calories have less risk of being higher than you need as well.

3. Maintain and push your training intensity.

Stay on top of your progress in the gym. Lift heavy, and keep the intensity if your workouts high for maximum stimulation of muscle synthesis. Brad Schoenfeld is an expert in body recomposition talks more about training for increasing muscle mass in this article. There is no way around it, to build muscle you constantly need to either increase the weight your body can move or reduce the time it takes you to shift a certain weight. These two training methods are employed by your big three mechanisms of hypertrophy; mechanical tension, metabolic stress and muscle damage. You can read more about these three mechanisms and how to train with them here.

## Content

### Whether you’re still on the fence about making the switch to a plant-based diet or are just now more ‘plant curious’ after bumping into some recent films and documentaries like [The Game Changers on Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/ph/title/81157840) during isolation, (features impressive elite plant-based athletes) there is no doubt about the powerful impacts this has on our health and our environment.

However, to many who are still in doubt and are quite skeptical, “Can I get enough protein on a plant-based diet?” is still the most asked question today.

**Short answer: Absolutely!**

First of all, protein plays an essential role to our bodies. It helps build and repair muscle to give us strength and mobility and increase fat burning. Although some of the best protein sources are from animal by-products and dairy protein like whey protein powders, it is good to note that plant-based protein works wonderfully as an alternative for plant-based diets especially for plant-based athletes.

Plant-based diets are typically vegetarian (which includes dairy products and eggs with most plant foods) and vegan (which completely eliminates all animal products)

### Can I get enough protein on a plant-based diet?

Eating more plant-based foods can certainly do wonders for your body as well as the world. You can find a variety of [protein-rich plant-based/vegan sources](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/diet-and-nutrition/sources-of-plant-based-protein?_pos=4&_sid=d278ab9bd&_ss=r) from fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes and the absence of or in reduced portions of meat or seafood.

Check out the list of protein-rich plant-based foods [here](/blogs/supplements/what-are-the-health-benefits-of-protein).

### Protein-on-the-go

If you're trying to get enough protein on a plant-based diet, there are a few things to know.

First, the amount of protein you need depends on your age, weight and activity level. The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for protein is 46 grams per day for women ages 19 to 70, and 56 grams per day for men in that age group.

The RDA is based on a 2,000-calorie diet; if you're eating less than that, you may need more protein. And if you're exercising more than usual — say, by running or lifting weights — then you may need more protein than the RDA suggests.

Second, there are many types of plant foods that contain protein: beans, lentils and peas; soy foods like tofu and tempeh; nuts and seeds; whole grains such as oats and brown rice; leafy green vegetables such as kale and spinach; quinoa (pronounced keen-wah); even certain fruits like avocados and bananas offer some protein benefits.

Protein powders can easily help you meet your daily protein requirements. The best protein powder to buy are dairy protein if your diet allows for it. If not, here’s the lowdown on the difference between the two.

### Whey Protein vs Plant Protein

Whey protein powder is the by-product of the cheese manufacturing process. It is the liquid that is left behind after straining the milk. Because of such process, lactose intolerance is one of the most common side effects from consuming whey protein.

Plant-based protein or vegan protein powders are easier digestible and don’t have the side effects associated with whey protein. They are also full of vitamins and minerals, antioxidants, and fiber.

### Best plant-based protein powders?

Our [VPA® Premium Plant Protein Powder](/products/premium-plant-vegan-protein) is 100% natural and designed specifically for vegans. Our plant protein powders come with a variety of best-tasting flavours with a hefty amount protein per serve. We have formulated them with the necessary vitamins and minerals vegans often lack.

Not sure which flavour to try on our Premium Plant vegan protein? We’re happy to help you try out all of our vegan flavours!

# Healthy and Cheap Tips for Natural Detox

Healthy and cheap tips for you to detox naturally after the holiday season with some items you may already have at home.

---

## Content

## When all the merry-making and indulging in all the delicious but usually unhealthy treats and drinks subsides, we are often left feeling bloated and sluggish. The same goes even as you have avoided all the unhealthy treats! Chances are, we are eating more than our usual food consumption and our bodies are just not used to this sudden change.

Now it’s time to hit reset, feel fresh, energized and give your body a reboot and a complete overhaul. Firstly, it’s great to note that our awesome bodies detox naturally 24/7. But our bodies need to fight off pathogens, trap and expel pollutants and maintain homeostasis which is the inner balance in the body. And to help support this, the best way is to do it naturally as opposed to those many detox trends/fads that are costly and often built for the hype.

Here we’ve gathered some healthy and cheap ways for you to detox naturally with some items you may already have at home.

### 1. Hydrate your body.

#### Lemon water

Lemons contain ascorbic acid which assists in the cleansing process. To reap its benefits, one must drink it consistently and it only works with fresh lemon juice, not artificial ones. Among its benefits are the following:

- Good source of Vitamin C
- Supports weight loss
- Aids digestion
- May prevent kidney stones

##### Here’s a recipe to try:

- Squeeze half a lemon into 8 ounces of water.
- To further infuse the lemon to your water, you may include the properly washed rinds floating in your drink.
- You may also add mint, ginger, honey, cinnamon, or turmeric to get a healthier boost out of your lemon water drink.

![Lemon Water](https://i.shgcdn.com/67912ad4-140d-44a3-9e4f-b33040ac43b7/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

### Apple Cider Vinegar

The benefits you gain from the apple cider vinegar detox are both internal and external. Among the many are the following:

- Supports a healthy immune system
- Helps with weight control
- Helps remove “sludge toxins” from the body
- Adds good bacteria for the gut
- Aid with healthy digestion

##### Here’s a recipe to try:

- 1-2 tablespoons of raw, unfiltered apple cider vinegar
- 8 ounces of purified or distilled water
- 1-2 tablespoons sweetener (organic honey, maple syrup, or 4 drops of Stevia)
- You may choose to take this drink 3 times a day.

![Apple Cider Vinegar](https://i.shgcdn.com/13099f64-b625-4fcb-9eee-72f4c716f764/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

## 2. Eat clean for at least a week.

# PCOS Nutrition and Supplements

When it comes to PCOS, it is highly recommended to prioritize your overall nutrition. However, there are a few supplements that can help. Here is a list provided by Accredited Practising Dietitian, Aidan Muir.

## Content

## When it comes to PCOS

When it comes to PCOS, quite a few supplements can help. [Prioritising your overall nutrition](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/proper-nutrition-in-2022) will help far more than any individual supplement, but supplements can certainly provide some value.

When it comes to supplements, often they are only beneficial whenever there is a deficiency or inadequate intake. Adding the supplement in addition to an already optimal intake likely won’t provide any additional benefit. So, keep that in mind since a lot of these needs can be met through food as well. Supplements are just the icing on the cake. If you would like to learn more about nutrition in general for PCOS, [I recommend reading this post](https://idealnutrition.com.au/nutrition-for-pcos-a-dietitians-guide).

PCOS can’t technically be cured, but these might help reduce symptoms related to menstruation, excess hair growth, ovulation, fertility, testosterone, insulin resistance and many more.

---

## Inositol

There is a lot of solid evidence for how Inositol can help people with PCOS. It appears to improve [insulin sensitivity, lower testosterone and aid fertility](http://www.europeanreview.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/1896-1903.pdf).

The recommended dosage is 2-4g per day of Myo-inositol.

---

## Omega 3's

[Omega 3’s](https://wearefeel.com/products/feel-algae-omega-3) can help reduce inflammation and improve metabolic markers such as cholesterol and blood pressure. It may also help [reduce testosterone and help with the regularity of the menstrual cycle](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3941370).

Ideally, you would obtain this through food by consuming fish 2-3 times per week (at least one time is oily fish such as salmon) or consuming plant-based options such as seeds or walnuts.

The recommended dosage is 1000-3000mg daily if you are supplementing.

---

## Cinnamon

Cinnamon may help under certain circumstances. It can potentially help [menstrual cycle irregularities](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24813595). It can also [aid blood glucose](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17296187) control by improving glucose use in cells and slowing the rate at which glucose enters the blood.

The recommended dosage is 1-2g per day.

---

## Zinc

Zinc can be effective for [reducing hair growth or reducing hair loss](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26315303?log$=activity) associated with PCOS. It can also potentially help [reduce insulin resistance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6250088).

The dosage used in research is 50mg/per day, which is significantly higher than the RDI of 8mg/day. For reference, most people do not reach the RDI consistently through food.

---

## Magnesium

Magnesium can help [improve insulin sensitivity and, if taken at night, reduce fasting blood glucose levels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21205110) (BGL's).

The recommended dosage is 300-400mg, taken one hour before going to bed. However, I would wager that this won't be necessary if you meet your magnesium needs through foods. Though, the vast majority of people do not meet the RDI for magnesium through food. Therefore this potentially could be helpful for quite a few people.

---

## N-acetylcystein (NAC)

A bit of research indicates that NAC may lead to [improvements in pregnancy and ovulation rates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4306416). This is a bit of a watch in this space area, though, as the evidence isn’t very strong yet.

NAC increases the cellular levels of antioxidants and reduces glutathione at higher doses. Theoretically, this can translate to improved insulin sensitivity, but the current research doesn’t support that in practice.

The dosage commonly used in research is 1200-1800mg per day.

### Stress and Anxiety

Stress is a normal biological response to a perceived challenge or demand. In short bursts, it is completely healthy and forces the body to adapt and overcome. However, when stress is prolonged, it is detrimental to our health and associated with numerous chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, dementia, and mental health conditions such as anxiety syndrome. The American Psychological Association (APA) defines anxiety as “an emotion characterized by feelings of tension, worried thoughts and physical changes like increased blood pressure.” It is estimated that ~14% of adults and ~7% of children experience generalized anxiety disorder, making it one of the most common of all mental health conditions.

We’ve all felt stress and anxiety at some point in our lives. A racing heart, a flushed face, queasiness in our stomach; it’s not a feeling that is enjoyed. Frustratingly, stress and anxiety are not always produced by genuine threats, which means that everyday activities can cause us anxiety. This includes things like important events, starting a new job, waiting for an important call, speaking in front of people (in fact a survey once found that people were more afraid of public speaking than death), and sometimes anxiety is caused by no obvious reason at all.

### What Actually Happens When We Feel Stressed or Anxious?

Well, first the brain receives a stressful input at the hypothalamus, then it communicates with a gland at the base of the brain called the pituitary gland. This gland produces important stress hormones, which then stimulate other important glands on top of the kidneys called the adrenal glands. This pathway is called the HPA axis and is our major stress pathway. At this point, more hormones are produced which then cause stress responses such as increased blood pressure, increased fat and glucose production, protein breakdown, constriction of blood vessels, increased respiration, and pupil dilation. This is called the fight or flight response.

### Men and Women Experience and Deal with Stress Differently

Men tend to experience stress more strongly, partly because women produce more oxytocin, which offsets the effects of cortisol and epinephrine (powerful stress hormones produced by the adrenal glands). Women also have stronger innate immune systems, making them more resilient to stress but placing them at increased risk for autoimmune diseases. Women also tend to deal with stress differently, seeking support and relationships during periods of stress and anxiety, whereas men tend to deal with stress in a true fight or flight manner (bottle it up, try and escape or fight back).

## Why Fad Diets Do Not Work

We've most probably all been guilty of searching for "effective diet" or "best diet plan" on the internet, but every time we try it, it just simply doesn't work. In this blog, we'll discuss why fad diets do not work, and what actually can work for you.

---

## Content

### What are fad diets?

Fad diets are widely advertised and promise simple methods to shed unwanted ‘weight’ quickly (note ‘weight’ not necessarily body fat!)

---

Often times, when something feels like it is too good to be true, it usually is. However, with mounting pressures surrounding weight loss and body ideals, this market continues to grow as a result of capitalising on those who are desperate.

---

During 2017-2018, an estimated 67% of Australians aged 18 and over were either overweight or obese. With shocking statistics like these, it is not surprising many have turned to fad diets to solve their issues.

---

### Why do fad diets exist?

In some cases, there can be new science emerging that gives some credibility to a particular dietary approach. For instance, avoiding carbs in the morning may actually be a useful approach for certain individuals. Here, working with a nutritionist or dietician is of significant importance, as the one-size-fits-all approach fad diets promote will not hold true. Unfortunately, this isn’t always the case with the reasoning behind a fad diet, whereby a lot of these trends are actually based around financial gain.

---

These trends often entail drastic protocols or short term challenges. While the list is exhaustive, a few notable mentions include the infamous Vogue ‘egg and wine diet, more recent “Juice Cleanses” and “Broth diets”, products like “weight loss/fat burning shakes” or even practises like “No carbs before 12 noon”.

---

### Why don’t they work?

Fad diets ultimately fail to promote the most important fundamental of health, fitness and nutrition; a sustainable approach. Whatever the goal, it’s going to take hard work, dedication and time. More often than not, it is the consistent behaviours of an individual, not their specific approach, that yields the positive outcome. Further to this, it’s vital to recognise that different approaches are not only available, but also necessary, as individuals have legitimate reasons to take a varied approach. Often, a strict fad diet won’t promote behavioural change or account for an individual’s needs. This heavy restriction can actually leave dieters worse than when they started, with malnutrition from being overly restrictive, and a decreased level of motivation and self-confidence, having already ‘failed’ to get the unrealistic result of the fad diet.

---

### So, what does work?

The good news is, many different approaches work, and have proven to be safe and effective. Opting for a tailored approach is always going to suit an individual more than following a roughly set out, fad-orientated plan. Being patient and having a realistic understanding of what it’s going to take to reach a goal will help to set one’s mindset for success.

---

Following sound nutrition science principles such as creating a reasonable caloric deficit or surplus, including a wide variety of foods, and adjusting the approach to an individual’s needs are the basis for legitimate dieting. Here, reading widely to better understand nutrition science, or working with a nutritionist or dietician will be good places to start.

Ginger has been used for centuries as a spice to enhance flavor and as an herbal remedy. This root vegetable has been shown to have significant health benefits. It can be found in many recipes, from stir-fries to curries and can even be enjoyed as ginger ale or ginger beer.

### Here are a couple of benefits that Ginger has and why it is perfect as a health drink!

---

#### High in Fiber

Ginger is rich in fiber that helps the digestive system function well. The fiber in Ginger can also act as prebiotics, and these substances help to get rid of bad bacteria and increase good bacteria such as lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.

Anything that is high in fiber is helpful when it comes to [weight loss](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3408800/). Fiber helps the body feel full and satisfied to avoid overeating and to control your appetite. It also helps regulate your bowel movement and promotes a healthy digestive tract.

---

#### Helps Improve Digestion

Ginger has been used for many years to help with digestion. Ginger can help inhibit the activity of bacteria in the stomach and intestines, promoting the production of gastric acid and improving digestion.

The active compound in Ginger, gingerol, is a powerful anti-inflammatory that helps relieve swelling throughout the digestive tract. Ginger can also help prevent gas and bloating by calming down contractions in the intestinal walls. Ginger also improves digestion by increasing stomach acid production, which helps us to absorb nutrients better and keep our stomachs healthy.

---

#### Has Relaxing Effect

Ginger drinks are soothing and relaxing. Some would say that it is due to the aroma that Ginger has. But really, it is due to the gingerol in the drink. Gingerol has calming properties, which makes any ginger drinker get that relaxing effect.

Ginger even showed [lower oxidative stress levels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92775/). That’s also because when you drink Ginger, your body starts to produce serotonin. This hormone is responsible for giving you a calming effect.

---

#### Strengthens Immune System

Our immune system protects us from diseases and illnesses such as flu, cold, or fever. The ginger drink may help strengthen the immune system due to its [antibacterial properties](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4106649/).

Ginger has been shown to have antioxidant and [anti-inflammatory properties](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3665023/) that help to boost immunity and fight some bacteria and viruses.

---

#### Has Vitamins and Minerals

Though not all ginger drinks are created equal, they do contain some vitamins and minerals. Including ginger drinks in your diet can provide you with essential nutrients such as vitamin C, magnesium, calcium, potassium, and copper.

It is essential to have vitamins and minerals because they play a significant role in our bodies. They help us digest food, make hormones, and fight disease.

These are just some of the reasons why [VPA®](https://www.vpa.com.au/) is excited for you to try the new Ginger Health drink. You get all these benefits in a Ginger Health Drink! Now, that is a deal!

**SEO Description:** When you're working on your fitness goal and eating right to achieve results, is it necessary to bid farewell to your favourite desserts and guilty pleasures? Here are pros and cons to cheat days.

## Excerpt

## Content

## When you’re working on your fitness goal whether it is for muscle gain or weight loss, it is a fact that eating right makes up a huge part of achieving great results. To achieve this, one might follow a diet plan consisting of healthy balanced meals which are sometimes calculated to fit one’s required macros for each day. 

Depending on which diet plan you wish to set out on, and with your doctor or dietitian’s advice of course, it is important that your diet or fitness program is flexible and well balanced to ensure that you are not totally cutting out entire food groups like certain fad diets might promote.

But is it necessary to bid farewell to your favourite desserts and guilty pleasures forever?

This has been one of the great debates in the fitness community- so we’re here to discuss the matter. 

Should you have cheat meals or cheat days?

Let’s dive in.

## First let’s define what cheat meals are. 

Unless you’ve been training under a rock, when diets become too restrictive and we begin to feel too deprived, it is natural to start craving and aggressively yearn for pizzas, doughnuts, and cakes. We all probably have used the term at least more than once as an excuse to indulge in our favourite food and sometimes with good reason.

To put it simply, “cheat days” are our days off from clean eating and these are supposed calculated and planned within the diet plan – not random outbursts of binge eating. While some may do without it, some can find it a vital part of their week.

## Cons | Downsides of Having Cheat Days 

When a dieter goes without a limit on their cheat days or cheat meals, they set themselves for failure and this statement presents different outcomes for different people.

- While some can view cheat days as a welcome rest from strict self-discipline, for others it can trigger a loss of self-control and lead to binge eating while carrying a mindset of guilt from the lapse. Thus, they end up throwing all one’s progress down the drain – this behaviour is known as the [Abstinence Violation Effect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/abstinence-violation).

- Cheat days work against you when you out-eat your training. 

This means cheat day indulgences still come with moderation. This is why big cheat meals may not be a big deal for the likes of Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, as he is an ex-wrestler who has built up a diet and exercise routine over decades, but it may affect someone who is a beginner in their fitness journey. So, it all boils down on how hard you train.

---

## Pros | Benefits of Having Cheat Days 

With all the cons that ultimately lead to negative effects of cheat days, why do some people still bother?

- The answer: Leptin.

Caloric deficits cause a significant drop in your metabolic rate. Research shows that restricting calories as done when eating on a caloric deficit can cause the hormone called [leptin to decrease](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9316457/). 

**What is leptin?**

Leptin is a hormone produced by fat cells in the body to control metabolism and hunger. It [regulates your energy](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12079865/) and prevents you from either starving or over-eating. So, cheat days or cheat meals boost your metabolism by increasing levels of leptin in your body.

- Cheat days can also be regarded as a reward-based diet strategy for sustainable weight loss. It teaches you balance and moderation – something strict fat diets never do. This way, you can still have space for occasional indulgences and help you adopt clean-eating more doable for the long run.

### Why is it important to eat after a workout?

After a workout, whether it is a high-intensity session or not, it is important that we follow the right steps to take care of the body as much as during the actual exercise. Nutritious eating after training helps your body maximise the benefits that are gained from exercise, which means that you are making the most of the exercise you’ve just done – and you can get even stronger and faster just by eating right!

Here we’ve gathered more information on how food can help you recover after a workout and the right kinds of food to eat.

### Protein to restore muscle tissues

Your body’s number one priority after a workout is to replenish energy stores like electrolytes. Made up of amino acids, protein is needed by your body to repair muscle damage. You'll want to consume [20-40 grams of high-quality lean protein](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/benefits-of-whey-protein-isolate) after a workout to maximise protein synthesis, repair muscles and enhance muscle growth. Consuming the right nutrients soon after you exercise can help your body get this done faster.

### Why do you need to eat carbohydrates after an exercise?

Training sessions cause the glycogen stores in your body to be reduced, so your body won't have enough energy to start the recovery process unless you refuel those stores.

Carbohydrates are responsible for providing your body with the right amount of glycogen supply, which is the body's primary source of fuel, so you may want to think again if you're on a low-carb diet - especially if you perform high-intensity workouts more than one day a week.

A post-workout snack or meal that is high in carbohydrates provides energy and gives your muscles time to rebuild. Without this boost, your body will convert fat, followed by protein from the muscle tissues to usable energy, which means that your recovery will take even longer. The takeaway here is that carbohydrates are good for you!

### When and what you should eat after a workout

Exercise causes your body to lose fluids and important vitamins and minerals, especially if you sweat a lot. First, it’s important to assess and know your nutrient needs based on your level of exercise but whole foods are ultimately the best source of nutrition. Regardless of the time of day you exercise, it’s important to eat a healthy snack or meal that contains a combination of protein and carbohydrates.

For fastest recovery, eat within an hour right after finishing your workout. If you can’t grab a snack right away, eat within two hours. Hydrating your body correctly afterwards is also great in order to recover from a workout. Water is a great rehydrating option, and according to the Mayo Clinic, you should be drinking about two or three cups of water for every kilo lost during exercise. Water is often sufficient, but sports drinks containing electrolytes and carbohydrates can help replenish what the body has used up during the workout, especially those lasting over 60 minutes.

High protein snacks like protein balls or protein bars are a great option for post-workout fuel especially if you’re in a hurry, but when you have a bit of extra time it’s better to have a full-on meal instead.

# Reading Food Labels for Better Nutrition

Reading food labels can be tricky and confusing, and more often than not, we don't have the time to sit around and decipher what they mean. However, by following these few strategies, you can grasp the ins and outs of nutritional label reading to make a more informed choice on products at the supermarket and also when purchasing select supplements.

Labels generally are packaged following strict guidelines for food storage instructions or criteria for people with different allergies. While various types of information exist, it's essential to strip things back to make sense of all this information. Here are some tips to help make sense of nutritional panels and information.

- Use the Australian guide to healthy eating to decide whether that product belongs to the five main food groups or is it primarily a discretionary item only to be eaten on special occasions and in small amounts.
- When looking at the nutritional label, it's essential to consider the different columns and their meaning. Many of us make the common mistake of first reading the per serving column and jumping to conclusions. The main issue with this is that, unfortunately, not all products are made the same and often, serving sizes between products will vary subsequently. It's important to compare products on a level playing field.

This can be done by utilising the per 100g serving column. This column is a requirement and enables simple comparisons between products on different nutrients. When looking for the best option, try to avoid products with more than 10g of fat per 100g, less than 5g of fibre, more than 3g of saturated fat and more than 400mg of sodium.

The next strategy requires surveying the ingredients list to identify if any products contain added sugars or trans fats in the initial three ingredients. The ingredients in nutritional labels are ordered based on weight, and hence the main three ingredients in any product will make up the major component of that product. Try to look for complex carbohydrate sources, whole wheat or wholegrains or plant-based oils (olive oil, canola oil, flaxseed oil) as opposed to white flour, sugar or hydrogenated oils. To lose weight, we need to drink/eat fewer calories than our bodies use. Often these calories come from a combination of macronutrients, including fat, protein and carbohydrate. If oils or added sugars sit high on the ingredients list, it is a good chance the energy content for that product will be quite high.

The health star rating system provides convenient, relevant and readily understood nutritional information at a glance. Whilst it doesn't provide the breadth of information you would get from reading the nutritional panel completely. It does allow the ability to compare products at a glance.

Percentage recommended daily intakes (RDI's) is often an excellent way to compare the nutrients in one serve of food with the average adult's needs. Like nutritional claims, this information can guide the needs of individuals. However, some better strategies include consulting with an Accredited Dietitian to get more tailored dietary information or utilising apps like my fitness pal or calorie counter.

No matter what diet a person follows, understanding nutritional information is important in choosing healthy food. By looking at calories, carbs, protein, and fat content, it's easy to find enjoyable and good foods for you.

# Carbohydrates and Exercise

Carbohydrates are our primary source of energy. Explore the relationship between carbohydrates and exercise and why we need carbohydrates.

---

## Content

### What are carbohydrates?

Your body needs carbohydrates in order to fuel your muscles. Despite following healthy routines and habits, without the right amount of carbohydrates, you are often left feeling weak and low on energy during workouts. This is because carbohydrates are our primary source of energy.

### What are the types of carbohydrates?

There are three types of carbohydrates: starches, fiber, and sugars.

- **Starches** – They are considered complex carbohydrates, which are made up of simple sugars. Starches are broken down by our body to fuel energy.
- **Fibers** – They are considered complex carbohydrates. Eating foods with fiber keep you full. This is because our body is not able to break down most fibers.
- **Sugars** – They are considered simple carbohydrates and can be added to foods. They are found in added sugars in desserts, candy, sodas, etc.

### Importance of carbohydrates on exercise

- **Prevents muscle breakdown**
  Protein and carbohydrates make a great pair. As long as you eat a good amount of carbs, protein can repair and build muscle tissues.

- **Carbs before a workout boosts performance**
  Eating carbs 1-2 hours before your work out helps maintain optimal levels of blood glucose and maximizes the results of your training.

- **They accelerate recovery**
  Eating carbs after a workout is equally as important as eating carbs before a workout. After a long workout, eating carbohydrates will help you replenish the energy that was used up.

### Foods that have carbohydrates

- Grains, such as bread, noodles, pasta, oatmeal, quinoa, and rice
- Fruits, such as apples, bananas, berries, mangoes, melons, and oranges
- Dairy products, such as milk and yogurt
- Legumes, including dried beans, lentils, and peas
- Starchy vegetables like corn, carrots, potatoes, sweet potato, and peas

### How many carbs should I eat?

The amount can vary from person to person. Multiple factors come into play such as age, sex, lifestyle, dietary restrictions. People should consume 45-65% of their calories from carbohydrates on average daily. However, it is still important to pay attention to which carbs are good to eat. For example, consuming whole grains give you much more nutrients compared to refined grains. Another would be eating foods that are low in fat but high in potassium like beans, lentils, and peas.

**SEO Title:** Artificial Sweeteners and Their Effect on Your Health

**SEO Description:** Artificial sweeteners are commonly found in food and drinks. They are cheaper than real sugar and have fewer calories but their impact on your health is more complex than we think.

---

## Excerpt

## Content

Artificial sweeteners or sugar substitutes have a controversial record. Although they may have been developed to help people lose weight, many studies have shown [artificial sweeteners may actually cause an increase in weight](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18535548/).

## What is an artificial sweetener?

Artificial sweeteners are chemical compounds that help reduce the amount of sugar in food. They are used to sweeten many foods and drinks, such as soft drinks, desserts, and chewing gums. However, they are not natural products but rather synthetic substances created in a laboratory.

---

## Why do people use artificial sweeteners?

Artificial sweeteners are sugar substitutes added to food and drinks to make them taste sweet. They're often used by people who need to limit their sugar intake for health reasons.

There are many types of artificial sweeteners, including aspartame, sucralose, saccharin, and acesulfame potassium (AceK). These substances are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but they can still cause side effects if you consume too much of them.

---

## What are the side effects of consuming too many artificial sweeteners?

### They cause binging on real sugar and carbs.

[Artificial sweeteners can mess with your brain's chemistry](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6952499/), which can lead to overeating. When you consume artificial sweeteners, your brain doesn't receive the message that it's receiving sugar, so you're more likely to keep eating until you get enough calories (and sometimes even beyond).

### They have harmful effects on the microbiome.

A healthy gut microbiome keeps your immune system strong, protects against disease-causing bacteria, and regulates metabolism. [Artificial sweeteners may disturb this balance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7817779/) by affecting the gut flora in ways we don't yet understand. There's little research on how artificial sweeteners affect gut bacteria in humans, but studies in mice suggest that they could disrupt their natural balance by altering the makeup of their stomach contents.

### They can cause metabolic problems.

Artificial sweeteners can trick your body into thinking it's getting real sugar, increasing insulin levels, and blood glucose, and this can lead to diabetes and other metabolic problems over time.

### They were found to be carcinogenic.

A [new study](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003950) has been released where researchers looked at the health effects of consuming artificial sweeteners in 102,865 adults. They were able to conclude that artificial sweeteners were linked to an increased risk for cancer.

### May cause allergic reactions.

Artificial sweeteners can cause allergic reactions in some people. The most common side effect is hives, which are [typically caused by aspartame](https://www.atlanticspineclinic.com/chiropractic-blog/147/Aspartame+Poisoning#:~:text=Hives%20and%20intense%20itching%2C%20lip,can%20occur%20due%20to%20aspartame.&amp;text=Metabolism%20and%20hormones%20are%20the,our%20overall%20health%20and%20wellness.). Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. People who are allergic to one artificial sweetener may also be allergic to others. If you think you might be sensitive to artificial sweeteners but don't know which one it is, try eliminating all types of sweeteners from your diet for two weeks. You can then reintroduce them one at a time before eating or drinking anything that contains them again.

**SEO Title:** Glutamine: The Most Overlooked Nutrient In Your Diet

**SEO Description:** Glutamine plays a key role in muscle building and recovery, but too many people overlook it. You should never go without glutamine, and here's why.

## Content

Undervalued and overlooked by many, glutamine is a powerful anti-catabolic agent. This means it's essential for combatting muscle loss. Here's how this most underrated of nutrients can boost your health, longevity, and physique!

---

## What is glutamine?

Glutamine is an amino acid that is naturally produced by the body. It is found in the blood, muscle tissue, and other cells. The body can use glutamine as a source of energy, or it can be converted into glucose (sugar), used as fuel by the brain. Glutamine also helps to maintain the average nitrogen balance in the body.

When you exercise, your body needs more glutamine than normal to protect your muscles from damage and help them rebuild after exercise. By supplementing with glutamine, you can increase your muscle mass and improve your recovery time after training to train harder and more often.

---

## Benefits:

### Improves gut health

Glutamine helps the body heal in this condition, the intestinal lining becomes damaged and allows bacteria, toxins, and undigested food particles to enter the bloodstream resulting in chronic inflammation and immune system dysfunction. Glutamine also helps reduce bloating by stopping water retention in cells.

### Lowers cholesterol levels

[Studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25466655/) have shown that taking glutamine supplements may lower cholesterol levels. This is because glutamine helps prevent fat storage in the body by preventing muscle loss during exercise and reducing insulin resistance, which encourages fat storage.

### Reduces brain fog

Glutamine supplementation has improved mental clarity and focus due to its role as an energy source for your brain cells (neurons). In addition, glutamine helps boost serotonin levels, improving mood, memory recall, and concentration abilities.

### Potential risks

Glutamine supplements can cause adverse effects in some people. These side effects include diarrhea and nausea due to overstimulation of the GI tract from high doses.

In addition to these GI disturbances, [some studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19533301/) suggest that supplementing with glutamine could increase your risk of kidney stones or other kidney-related problems. Always consult a physician prior to any intake of supplements.

---

## How to increase glutamine intake

The best way to increase glutamine intake is by eating foods high in nutrients.

**Here are some of the best sources of glutamine:**
- Beef (steak)
- Chicken breast
- Pork tenderloin
- Fish such as tuna, salmon, cod, and halibut
- Beans like black beans, kidney beans, and chickpeas

One should take [3-6 grams](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-glutamine#:~:text=with%20these%20conditions.-,Amounts%20and%20Dosage,grams%20daily%20in%20our%20diet.) daily. For others, this may not be feasible, which makes [supplementation needed.](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/l-glutamine)

Glutamine is a naturally occurring amino acid that can be taken in supplement form. In the end, consider both pros and cons of taking glutamine to ensure your results are as positive as possible with minimal risk of side effects.

Consistency in training and clean eating go hand-in-hand if you wish to see results in your workout. Clean eating is essentially a diet that is based on eating whole foods and avoiding processed and refined foods. Not only does nutritious food aid in building muscle, but they also fuel up your body for training. By eating the right foods and hydrating in the right amounts at the right times, you will perform better while seeing the best results.

### Before a Workout

It is crucial to fuel up, especially before you do intensive training. It is ideal to do so two hours before. Without any food in your system to aid in your workouts, you won't have enough energy to maximize your exercise, and you will ultimately limit your ability to burn calories.

Before engaging in any physical activity, you must hydrate with water. Eating carbohydrates like whole wheat toast, whole grain cereals, brown rice, pasta, yogurt, and fruits and vegetables, among others, is a great way to kickstart your fueling-up process. If you are in a hurry and can't grab a hearty meal, having a piece of fruit such as a banana or a light snack such as whole grain crackers or a good pre-workout is also a good way to gear up for your workout.

We've also written a whole guide on what to eat before after training [here](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/diet-and-nutrition/our-complete-guide-on-what-to-eat-before-and-after-a-workout).

### October is finally upon us and with it comes one of the most celebrated holidays of the year – Halloween! Whether you’re the type to stay in, put on a classic scary movie with a bowl of popcorn and lollies on your lap, or the type to go out and party with your friends, it’s always good to keep in mind these spooky health facts that’ll have your health and fitness in check.

---

#### Scary Sugars

Did you know that Australians are now consuming more sugar than ever before, and most especially during Halloween?

In 2011-12 the Australian Health survey revealed that Australians consumed 60 grams of sugar per day, or 14 full teaspoons. Now, keep that stat in mind and imagine how much more kilograms of candies are sold and consumed worldwide on this holiday.

Candy is filled with processed sugars and on top of that, manufacturers add chemically produced sugar, typically high fructose corn syrup, to many other foods and drinks.

---

#### Besides providing a boost of energy that the body can use, processed sugar doesn’t provide any benefits to the body—it lacks the fiber and health-promoting nutrients that occur in natural sugar sources like fruit.

Having a piece now and then is all good, but these empty calories will for sure keep you up at night.

---

#### Blood-curling Booze

What’s a party without a bit of alcohol involved?

You’ve heard of “drink responsibly”, but do you know just exactly how alcohol can decrease overall physical fitness? Drinking alcohol regularly can and will negatively affect your performance in the gym, when you play sports, and in everyday life.

Alcohol impairs your ability to perform at your highest level, costing you your hard-earned progress, or ending your workout early. It also dehydrates the body which may result in exhaustion of fatigue – which is not the ideal state to be in when you’ve got an early-morning run!

A drink here and there is fine but beware when Happy Hour quickly turns into Hangover Hour. The horror!

---

#### Junk Food Jump scares

A horror movie is never complete without a bag of snacks on hand. I mean, who walks into a movie theatre without at least a bowl of popcorn?

Whether you’re a salty or savoury snack kind-of-person, all junk foods are best taken occasionally or in moderation. “Junk food” is food that contains high levels of fats, salt and sugar and lacks nutrients such as fiber, vitamins and minerals. Eating these excessively will ultimately lead to short and long-term health complications, including weight gain, diabetes, and heart problems.

A smarter way of snacking is to understand the nutritional value of the food you eat and to be aware of advertising “tricks” that can also help you minimize your junk food intake. You can do this by reading the nutrition panel usually found on the back. You can use this guide on reading food labels so you can easily understand them and perform smarter and more informed decisions when choosing the food you eat.

Snacking shouldn’t be scary at all! Finding the right (and delicious!) ones for your body is all that matters. Check out our high protein and delicious snack recipes here.

---

#### Spine-chilling Sleep

The best thing after a long night or a good workout is the deep sleep that follows right after. Did you know that sleep plays a significant role in your overall fitness and health?

Nutritious food isn’t the only thing that fuels your workouts – consider good rest and recovery part of the equation. Good sleep offers the body and brain time to restore and recover, affecting nearly every tissue in the body which is why athletes and gym rats also look into supplementing with GABA, ZMA6 Recovery, collagen, and more.

## Content

With so many different protein bars on the market it can be difficult to differentiate one from another. When it comes to VPA®’s wholefood protein bars, they’re packed full of protein but also many other naturally derived ingredients so that you can get the most from your snack. Skip those bars with long ingredient lists, sugar alcohols and synthetic colours, and just keep it simple with VPA®’s delicious raw protein bars.

Let’s look a little deeper into some of the ingredients you’ll find inside.

## Whey Protein Isolate

VPA®’s protein bars contain whey protein isolate (WPI) which is more quickly digested and absorbed by the body compared to other types of protein. Due to the way in which it is produced, WPI contains barely any carbohydrates, lactose and fat, and consists of up to 90% protein.

As WPI is fast absorbing it gets working straight away to support muscle growth and recovery following intense exercise. With over 18g of protein per serve, VPA®’s protein bars are up there with the best of the best.

## L-Glutamine

Glutamine is an amino acid found naturally in the body that is used to make proteins and to transport nutrients in the blood. It also supports the immune system and intestinal health; as glutamine is an important energy source for immune cells (such a white blood cells) and intestinal cells.

Due to its role in keeping intestinal cells healthy, glutamine may assist in maintaining the protective barrier between the intestines and the body; preventing harmful bacteria and toxins from exiting the intestines into the bloodstream which is known as leaky gut syndrome.

Glutamine supplementation may also prevent muscle breakdown, preserve protein stores in the body, plus decrease muscle soreness and fatigue post exercise.

## Natural Prebiotic Fibre

Another ingredient found in VPA®’s protein bars is prebiotic fibre. Prebiotics are food for the good bacteria in our gut so it’s important to consume sources of fibre so that gut bacteria can flourish and keep our immune system healthy. Soluble fibre also helps regulate bowel movements and may assist with decreasing cholesterol.

As fibre is slow to digest it leaves you feeling full and satisfied. In this way it can promote weight loss.

## Fava Bean Protein

Extracted from fava beans (commonly known as broad beans or faba beans), this plant-based protein is low in carbohydrates and fats, and contains an array of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.

Being a plant protein it both supports muscle growth and recovery, and contains natural fibre to support digestion.

### The holidays are here again. A time filled with family gatherings, good times, and food – lots of food. And despite it being the most wonderful time of the year, it’s not exactly compatible with a healthy lifestyle as it can be disruptive to your health and fitness routines.

While it’s also a great time to ease up on your diet and allow yourself to enjoy the holiday treats, it might be a good idea to come into the holidays armed with a plan to ensure you won’t go overboard and throw your progress out the window over the holiday break.

## So, here's our holiday feasting game plan:

### 1. Eat this, not that

Eating healthy doesn’t mean having to give up on your favourite holiday meals and treats. This is a great time to get creative. Take your delicious non-negotiable favourite holiday dish and see where you can swap ingredients for its healthier options!

#### Try out healthier ingredient swaps like:
- Non-fat plain Greek yoghurt in place of sour cream for dips and creamy dishes.
- Non-fat, 1% milk or buttermilk instead of cream or whole milk for mashed potatoes.
- Olive oil (EVOO) in lieu of butter to reduce saturated fat and add beneficial antioxidants

A home-cooked holiday spread allows you to gain control over what’s in your meals as opposed to ordering out. Plus, this can be a fun and wonderful family activity altogether in the kitchen.

### 2. Moderation, moderation, moderation

Moderation is an important aspect of healthy eating, and this is especially true during the holiday season.

#### Be mindful of your portion sizes with these simple tips:
- Fill your plate with healthy food first like vegetables as they hardly hold any caloric value.
- Next, fit in your favourite dishes that you really love.
- Eat slowly. Take the time to savour each bite and appreciate the flavors and textures of the dishes you're eating. This can help you feel more satisfied with smaller portions and can also make the meal more enjoyable overall.

### 3. Don’t starve yourself to save up for the big event

We’re all probably thinking it - "Maybe if I skip meals before Christmas dinner, I can “save up” my calories." While this may sound like a good idea, it proves to be counterproductive. This is because when you skip meals, your body goes into starvation mode and starts to hold onto calories, which can make it harder to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight. Additionally, when you’re faced with a decadent and oh-so-delicious spread of food whilst being starved, oh boy, you’re in big trouble. Skipping meals can lead to overeating which can negate any calories you might have saved by not eating earlier in the day.

#### What to do:
Instead of skipping meals, try to eat a balanced diet throughout the day, incorporating healthy foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. This will help to keep your energy levels up and prevent you from feeling overly hungry, which can lead to overeating.

### 4. Prioritise your sleep

It can be silly to talk about having a sleep schedule over the holidays. But [learn more about the importance of sleep](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/the-importance-of-sleep-is-sleep-the-reason-you-re-not-seeing-results-in-the-gym)

## Health and Wellness

Health and wellness are all the rave after the COVID-19 pandemic. People are buying into all things that promote health and wellness and we’re all here for it! One thing we particularly love is the emphasis on using natural ingredients and easy home remedies you can whip up in your own kitchen. Let food be thy medicine, and let medicine be thy food, am I right?

---

### So, let’s talk about ginger.

By now we already know that this root plant has been used for its culinary and medicinal purposes for thousands of years. Ginger has been shown to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-cancer properties, making it an effective natural remedy for a range of health conditions and symptoms, including nausea, indigestion, joint pain, menstrual pain, and more. Whether consumed as a drink or in its raw form, ginger is a versatile and beneficial addition to any healthy diet.

There’s plenty of ways to add ginger to your diet. Let’s get creative with simple, easy-to-make ginger beverages!

---

### Healthy Drinks with Ginger

With just a few fresh ingredients, these recipes are so easy to whip up and pack a lot of health benefits.

---

#### Turmeric, Ginger, Honey Shots

Firstly, you may want to wear gloves as working with turmeric badly stains clothes or any fabric. Gather your ginger and turmeric and peel the outer layer of its skin. Then chop them into manageable sizes for your juicer or blender. Squeeze and add the juice of lemons as desired and blend thoroughly. If using a blender, you can add the pulp to a cheese cloth and squeeze out the juice into a clean container and you should be left with a bright yellow elixir of amazing benefits! Store this in little 50-60ml bottles or in a tightly sealed container and store in the fridge. Take at least one shot a day and add this to your morning routine for best results!

---

#### Lemon, Ginger & Honey

Simply add freshly chopped ginger to boiling water and let it steep in the water for 5-7 minutes, or until the water has taken on a strong ginger flavor. Pour the ginger water into a mug. Squeeze the juice of one lemon into the mug. Stir in 2 tablespoons of honey, or to taste. Let the drink cool to a desired temperature and enjoy!

**Note:** You can enjoy this drink easily with our Ginger Health Drinks! Alternatively, you can also add additional spices such as cinnamon or nutmeg, to taste if desired.

---

#### Lemon, Ginger & Green Tea

The simple idea here is that you’re boiling together ginger, green tea bags of your choice, and a selection of other ingredients to create a very healthy drink.

**Note:** If you’re using VPA®’s Ginger Health Drinks, you may find that you can skip adding sugar or honey.

---

#### Lime-Ginger and Mint Slushie

This refreshing drink is something you can serve a crowd on a hot day. Simply use VPA®’s Ginger Health Drinks, and process all 3 ingredients in a blender with crushed ice. If you want to turn it into a refreshing cocktail, just add your choice of liquor! Add a bit of rum or vodka to create something sensational.

### It's never fun to arrive at your workout feeling lethargic or low on energy. One must take charge of their health and welfare in order to exert more energy for exercise and increase physical performance and results. What then causes us to feel fatigued?

According to [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7071235/), low energy often occurs because of our food intake. Our energy levels are strongly influenced by factors including the quality and quantity of the food we eat. It's true that we are what we eat, and while going for something sweet, caffeinated, or an energy drink can give us a quick lift, the crash that follows will leave us feeling even worse and more exhausted. So, how do we break the cycle?

Take control of your energy with nutrition and lifestyle changes that you can easily do today!

---

#### 1. Stock up on energy-boosting foods

Avoid overly processed food and make the switch to more nutrient-dense and balanced meals. Include complex carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats.

##### Complex carbohydrates

Foods provide vitamins, minerals, and fiber that are important to the health of an individual and they are a sustained source of energy.
- Whole-grain bread and pasta
- Oatmeal
- Chickpeas
- Brown rice
- Fruits and vegetables

---

#### Protein

Protein helps to repair and build muscles, and healthy fats, such as those found in nuts and seeds, provide energy, and help you feel full longer.
- Eggs
- Dairy
- Lean meats
- Chicken

---

#### Healthy fats

- Avocados
- Nuts
- Olive oil
- Fish

# Blog: Principles of Pre and Post Training Nutrition

This blog will break down the principles of pre and post training nutrition so you can make the most of your sessions.

---

## Content

## WHY IS PRE & POST WORKOUT NUTRITION IMPORTANT?

We get it. Knowing what to eat and when, can seem a bit confusing. Especially if you’re just getting started with a health and fitness goal. This blog will break down the principles of pre and post training nutrition so you can make the most of your sessions.

### 1. TIMING

**PRE-WORKOUT**

You want to consume some type of meal or snack within 3hrs of training. Depending on when you plan to workout, the size of the meal can change slightly. In short - the sooner you’re training, the smaller and easier to digest you want your meal.

**So that might look like one of the following:**
- A large meal 2-3hrs prior to training
- A medium/small meal 1-1.5hrs prior to training
- A small energy dense snack <1hr to training

This will allow your food to mostly digest by the time you head to your workout. This is essentially a golden window that ensures you utilise the Calories from your meal, while avoiding feeling lethargic or having any digestion discomfort while training.

**PRO TIP:**
Want to feel extra-ready for your session and get better performance? Consume about 3-6 m of caffeine per kg of bodyweight about 30 minutes prior to your training. The [Gold Coast Stim](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/pre-30-v2-pre-workout) (formerly Pre-30 V.2) is a great option to pick.

### 2. PROTEIN

When it comes to pre and post workout, protein is pretty important! It is the building blocks of your body and is principal to muscle growth and recovery. Having an adequate amount of protein will increase strength, muscle growth, lean body mass, and physical performance. So it’s something you want to keep in mind when planning your meals around your training.

Including around 20–40g of protein both before-and-after your training session is shown to maximally stimulate muscle growth. You want to pick a complete protein - like meat and eggs, or a complete plant-protein like tofu, tempeh or a soy-based protein.

**PRO TIP:**
A protein powder is a really useful and convenient way to get your protein in post-workout. Try a [Premium Plant Protein](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/premium-plant-vegan-protein) or [Whey Protein Isolate](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder).

**POST-WORKOUT**

You should ideally eat your post-workout meal ideally somewhere between 30-90 minutes after training. This will help quickly replenish the glycogen stores in your muscles and encourage optimal muscle protein synthesis to increase recovery, repair and muscle gain.

## Vegan Athletes and Supplements

Vegan and plant-based diets are continuing to grow in interest and popularity in both people looking to generally improve their health and fitness, as well as athletes chasing a competitive goal. It’s no secret that a vegan, vegetarian or plant-based diet brings a set of distinct considerations to achieving nutritional adequacy and optimal performance. But also a really interesting and unique result: some supplements become more effective.

### Creatine

Creatine is a non-protein amino acid, and one of the most highly studied sports supplements. This makes it arguably one of the most popular and effective muscle growth supplements in the market. By supplementing with creatine and saturating our body’s creatine stores, it helps increase muscle strength and power while delaying muscle fatigue. This means you can train a bit longer and with more intensity, resulting in subsequent muscle growth and strength improvements. You obtain a certain amount of creatine from the food you consume - typically from meat and seafood. But as plant-based athletes exclude meat from their diets, their existing muscle creatine stores are lower than their omnivorous buddies.

Consequently, implementing creatine supplementation is more effective at augmenting the creatine stores of vegan athletes - resulting in a more pronounced effect.

### Leucine

Leucine is an amino acid found in protein, and is one of nine essential amino acids that our body must obtain from food. It is most well known for its muscle-building properties. Specifically, Leucine is known as a catalyst for muscle protein synthesis as well as helping regulate several cellular processes, such as tissue regeneration and metabolism. So when it comes to growing muscle, if you don’t have enough leucine, it’s like trying to light a fire without a match. Leucine is easily found in animal-products, like chicken, beef, pork, tuna, dairy and eggs. And to optimize muscle growth, you want to eat an adequate amount of protein each day split across 3-6 meals, with 2.5-3g of leucine in each of those meals from the protein you consume.

But unlike animal proteins, plant proteins often have less than 1g of Leucine. The one exception is soy-based foods. Nevertheless, it’s more difficult for vegans to get enough leucine and frequently, to optimize their muscle growth. This may be particularly important if they’re an athlete, bodybuilder, or trying to build muscle. As a result, supplementing with leucine provides that amount they may be missing, helping them optimize their muscle growth more than someone who is omnivorous who already consumes a suitable amount of Leucine.

### Beta-Alanine

Beta-alanine is a non-essential amino acid which is a precursor to carnosine. Carnosine is highly concentrated in muscle and brain tissues, and offsets lactic acid build up in your muscles as a result of exercise. Carnosine, and in turn beta-alanine, helps reduce fatigue and improves athletic performance. Beta-alanine is consumed from foods like poultry and meat. As vegans and vegetarians avoid consuming meat, they ingest less beta-alanine and have lower concentrations of muscle carnosine.

This means that implementing beta-alanine supplementation on a plant-based diet leads to a more substantial increase in these muscle carnosine concentrations, which enhances performance in high intensity exercise.

## Intermittent Fasting and Menstrual Cycles

Intermittent fasting (IF) has gained popularity as a dietary approach for weight management and overall health. However, women may wonder how IF affects their bodies, specifically during different phases of their menstrual cycles. While research on this topic is limited, it is essential to understand the potential impact and considerations for women practicing intermittent fasting throughout their cycles.

In this article, we will explore the relationship between intermittent fasting and women's menstrual cycles, shedding light on the potential benefits and addressing important considerations for women who choose to incorporate fasting into their lifestyle.

### Understanding the Menstrual Cycle

The menstrual cycle consists of four phases: menstruation, the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase. Hormonal changes occur throughout these four phases, influencing energy levels, hunger, and overall well-being. Estrogen and progesterone levels fluctuate, leading to changes in metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and nutrient requirements.

With this knowledge, a one-way approach on IF would not be advisable throughout a woman’s cycle to address the needs of the body.

### Intermittent Fasting and Menstrual Phases

- **Menstruation:** During this phase, some women may experience increased hunger and cravings. It is essential to listen to your body's needs and provide adequate nourishment. Experimenting with a modified fasting approach, such as shorter time-restricted eating (e.g., shorter fasting windows) or focusing on nutrient-dense foods, may be beneficial.

- **Follicular Phase:** Estrogen is on the rise and results in energy levels being higher during this phase, and the body's sensitivity to insulin may increase. This phase is suitable for implementing intermittent fasting, as the body may have a better capacity to handle fasting periods.

- **Ovulation:** Ovulation typically occurs in the middle of the menstrual cycle. Some women may experience increased energy and improved mood. Adjusting fasting protocols, such as lengthening the feeding window or incorporating more nourishing meals, can support overall well-being.

- **Luteal Phase:** The luteal phase is characterized by hormonal changes, which can lead to cravings and fluctuations in mood. It is important to prioritize balanced nutrition and consider adjusting fasting protocols to accommodate individual needs during this phase.

### Important Considerations for Women

1. **Individual Variations**
2. **Nutrient Intake**
3. **Hormonal Health**
4. **Overall Well-being**

For more information and personalized guidance, consult with a healthcare provider or a nutritionist.

## Content

Have you ever noticed someone who seems to have a naturally muscular and athletic build? These individuals might have what's known as the mesomorph body type. In this article, we'll explore the mesomorph body type and provide answers to the top 3 questions related to the topic.

### What is the mesomorph body type?

The mesomorph body type is characterised by a muscular and athletic build that’s well-proportioned. People with this body type tend to have broad shoulders, narrow waists, and a naturally muscular physique. They have an easier time gaining muscle and losing fat than other body types.

They also have a naturally high metabolism that helps them burn calories quickly. However, mesomorphs are also prone to gaining weight easily, which means they need to be careful with their diet. They are often considered the middle ground between the ectomorph and endomorph [body types.](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/understand-your-body-type-and-eat-to-build-muscle)

### How can mesomorphs maintain their physique through diet and exercise?

A balanced diet is essential for mesomorphs to maintain their physique. They should focus on lean protein sources, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Mesomorphs can benefit from incorporating both cardio and strength training into their workouts. Strength training can help them build and maintain muscle mass, while cardio can help them burn fat and improve their overall fitness.

### What are some fitness tips for mesomorphs?

1. **Combine Strength and Cardio Training**
   Mesomorphs tend to respond well to both strength training and cardiovascular exercises. Incorporate a mix of resistance training, such as weightlifting or bodyweight exercises, to build and maintain muscle, as well as cardio workouts like running, cycling, or HIIT to improve cardiovascular fitness and burn calories.

2. **Prioritise [Progressive Overload](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/training/progressive-overload)**
   To continue making progress, it's important to progressively challenge your muscles. Gradually increase the intensity, weight, or repetitions of your exercises over time. This stimulates muscle growth and prevents plateaus.

3. **Emphasise Compound Exercise**
   [Compound exercises](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/training/isolation-vs-compound) engage multiple muscle groups simultaneously, leading to efficient muscle development and overall strength gains. Examples include squats, deadlifts, bench press, overhead press, and pull-ups. Include these exercises in your routine to maximize your potential.

4. **Maintain a Balanced Diet**
   As a mesomorph, you may have a higher metabolic rate and an easier time building muscle, but it's still crucial to maintain a balanced diet. Consume a variety of whole foods, including lean proteins, complex carbohydrates, healthy fats, and plenty of fruits and vegetables. Stay properly hydrated and consider consulting a registered dietitian or nutritionist to personalise your nutrition plan.

5. **Don't Skip Rest and Recovery**
   While it's important to challenge yourself, don't neglect rest and recovery. Adequate rest allows your muscles to repair and grow stronger. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night and incorporate rest days into your training schedule to prevent overtraining and reduce the risk of injury.

6. **Adjust Your Training as Needed**
   As your body adapts to your workouts, it's essential to periodically adjust your training program. This can involve changing exercises, rep ranges, or incorporating different training techniques to continuously challenge your muscles and avoid stagnation.

7. **Stay Consistent and Patient**

## Vitamin C

Vitamin C is an essential nutrient that plays a crucial role in maintaining overall health and well-being. It is renowned for its powerful antioxidant properties, which help protect the body against oxidative stress and chronic diseases. In this article, we will delve into the numerous benefits of vitamin C, its impact on collagen production, the immune system, and its potential role in preventing chronic diseases.

Additionally, we will answer some of the most-asked questions surrounding vitamin C, including its recommended daily intake, best food sources, effectiveness against colds, side effects of supplements, and its impact on the immune system.

### The Importance of Vitamin C

Vitamin C is a vital nutrient that our body needs for various cellular functions. Its antioxidant properties help counteract the damaging effects of free radicals, which can lead to chronic diseases and accelerated aging. Additionally, vitamin C plays a crucial role in collagen synthesis, promoting healthy skin, bones, and connective tissues.

### VITAMIN C HELPS BOOST THE IMMUNE SYSTEM

The immune system relies on vitamin C to function optimally. It supports the production and activity of white blood cells, which are responsible for fighting off infections and diseases. Research suggests that vitamin C can enhance immune function and reduce the risk of developing infections. Adequate intake of vitamin C can help strengthen the body's defenses and promote overall well-being.

### VITAMIN C AND CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION

Numerous studies have highlighted the potential protective effects of vitamin C against chronic diseases such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and certain types of cancer. The antioxidant properties of vitamin C help combat inflammation and oxidative stress, which are key contributors to these conditions. While more research is needed, incorporating vitamin C-rich foods into your diet may help reduce the risk of developing these ailments.

### VITAMIN C FOR COLD PREVENTION AND TREATMENT

One of the most well-known benefits of vitamin C is its ability to reduce the severity and duration of the common cold. Regular intake of vitamin C has been shown to boost immune function and reduce the risk of catching a cold. When taken at the onset of symptoms, vitamin C may help alleviate symptoms and promote a faster recovery. However, it is important to note that vitamin C is not a cure for the common cold, but rather a supportive measure for overall immune health.

### Recommended Daily Intake of Vitamin C

The recommended daily intake of vitamin C varies depending on age, gender, and life stage. According to a source, the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adults 19 years and older is 90 mg daily for men and 75 mg for women. For pregnancy and lactation, the amount increases to 85 mg and 120 mg daily, respectively. Smoking can deplete vitamin C levels in the body, so an additional 35 mg beyond the RDA is suggested for smokers.

While the tolerable upper intake level is the maximum daily intake unlikely to cause harmful effects on health. The UL for vitamin C is 2000 mg daily; taking beyond this amount may promote gastrointestinal distress and diarrhea. Only in specific scenarios, such as under medical supervision or in controlled clinical trials, are amounts higher than the UL sometimes used.

### What are the best natural sources of Vitamin C?

## What is Medium-Chain triglyceride?

Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) are a type of dietary fat that has gained popularity due to their numerous health benefits. Unlike long-chain triglycerides (LCTs) and short-chain triglycerides (SCTs), MCTs contain medium-length fatty acid chains, which make them unique and beneficial for our bodies. In this article, we will explore the many advantages of incorporating MCTs into your diet and address the top questions related to this supplement.

## Benefits of Medium-Chain Triglyceride or MCT

### Improved Energy Levels

One of the most significant benefits of MCTs is their ability to provide an immediate source of energy. MCTs are rapidly absorbed by the body and quickly converted into ketones, which are utilised as fuel by our cells. This makes MCTs an excellent choice for athletes, individuals following a ketogenic diet, or those looking for a natural energy boost. Incorporating MCTs into your pre-workout routine or consuming MCT oil can help optimise your energy levels and improve overall performance.

### Enhanced Cognitive Function

MCTs have also been shown to have positive effects on cognitive function. The brain can easily utilise ketones derived from MCTs as an alternative energy source, which can improve mental clarity, focus, and memory. This is particularly beneficial for individuals with neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease, as MCTs may offer an alternative fuel source for brain cells that are unable to utilise glucose effectively. Emerging research in this field is promising and supports the potential cognitive benefits of MCTs.

### Weight Management

If you're looking to shed some extra pounds or maintain a healthy weight, MCTs may be a valuable addition to your dietary regimen. MCTs have been shown to increase satiety, meaning they help you feel fuller for longer, reducing the likelihood of overeating. Additionally, MCTs have been found to boost metabolism and promote the burning of stored fat. By incorporating MCTs into your diet, you may experience improved weight management and increased fat burning.

### Digestive Health Support

A [healthy gut](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/diet-and-nutrition/the-brain-gut-connection-and-its-role-in-our-well-being) is crucial for overall health, and MCTs can contribute to a well-functioning digestive system. MCTs possess natural antibiotic properties that can help inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria in the gut while supporting the growth of beneficial bacteria. This balance of gut flora is essential for proper digestion, immune function, and nutrient absorption.

### Anti-Inflammatory Properties

Chronic inflammation is a leading cause of many health conditions, including arthritis and cardiovascular diseases. MCTs have been found to possess anti-inflammatory properties, which can help reduce inflammation in the body. By incorporating MCTs into your diet, you may experience a reduction in inflammation and an improvement in the symptoms associated with chronic inflammatory conditions.

### Enhanced Nutrient Absorption

MCTs can also enhance the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and other nutrients in the body. For example, the consumption of MCTs alongside a meal or supplement that contains fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin E, calcium, or magnesium can improve their bioavailability and absorption. This ensures that your body receives the maximum benefit from the nutrients you consume.

### Skin and Hair Benefits

In addition to their internal health benefits, MCTs can also contribute to healthier skin and hair. MCTs possess moisturising properties that can help hydrate and nourish the skin, leaving it soft and supple. Furthermore, the antibacterial properties of MCTs make them suitable for addressing certain skin conditions. Additionally, incorporating MCT oil into hair care products can promote stronger and healthier hair by nourishing the scalp and preventing breakage.

## How to incorporate MCTS into your diet

Now that you're aware of the many benefits of MCTs, you may be wondering how to incorporate them into your daily routine. Here ar...

# Spring Cleaning Your Nutrition Habits

Discover 10 practical tips for spring cleaning your nutrition habits and maintaining a healthier diet. Learn how to assess your current habits, set realistic goals, clean out your pantry, and more!

---

## Content

### As the seasons change, why not take the opportunity to give your nutrition habits a fresh start? Spring cleaning isn't just for decluttering your home; it can also be applied to your diet. By making small, sustainable changes and focusing on progress rather than perfection, you can improve your overall health and well-being. In this article, we will explore ten effective strategies for cleaning up your nutritional habits.

---

#### 1. START BY ASSESSING YOUR CURRENT NUTRITION HABITS

Before embarking on any dietary changes, it's essential to evaluate your current eating patterns. Take a close look at what you're currently consuming and identify areas that need improvement. Are you eating enough fruits and vegetables? Are you consuming too many processed or sugary foods? By identifying your strengths and weaknesses, you can create a targeted plan for improvement.

---

#### 2. Set realistic goals

Instead of attempting a complete diet overhaul, focus on making small, sustainable changes. Setting unrealistic expectations can lead to frustration and a higher chance of giving up. Start by identifying one or two areas where you can make manageable changes and build from there. For example, if you currently skip breakfast, set a goal to incorporate a healthy breakfast into your routine three times a week.

---

#### 3. Clean out your pantry and fridge

To eliminate temptations and set yourself up for success, it's crucial to remove any unhealthy snacks or processed foods from your pantry and fridge. Donate or discard items that do not align with your nutrition goals. Instead, stock up on healthier alternatives such as whole-grain snacks, nuts, and seeds.

---

#### 4. Stock up on healthy staples

A well-stocked kitchen makes it easier to maintain a healthy diet. Ensure your fridge and pantry are filled with nutritious options like fresh fruits and vegetables, lean proteins (such as chicken breast or tofu), whole grains (like quinoa or brown rice), and healthy fats (such as avocados or olive oil). Having these staples readily available will make it simpler to prepare nourishing meals.

---

#### 5. Plan your meals ahead of time

Meal planning and preparation can help you stick to your new nutrition habits. By dedicating time each week to plan your meals and prepare ingredients in advance, you'll be less likely to make impulsive, unhealthy choices. Consider creating a [weekly meal plan](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/3-ways-to-meal-prep-and-cut-down-cooking-time) and grocery shopping list, and preparing some meals ahead of time to save time and make healthier eating more convenient.

The liver plays a vital role in detoxifying our bodies, filtering out harmful substances and keeping us healthy. However, our modern lifestyle and exposure to environmental toxins can put a burden on this vital organ. Luckily, there are natural ways to support liver detoxification and improve its function. In this article, we will explore the best practices for maintaining a healthy liver and answer some of the most common questions to provide you with a comprehensive guide to liver health.

## How does a liver detox work?

When we talk about liver detox, we are referring to the process of cleansing and eliminating toxins from the liver. The liver performs two phases of detoxification. In the first phase, enzymes convert toxins into less harmful substances. In the second phase, these substances are further broken down and eliminated from the body. This process relies on the liver's ability to produce enzymes and antioxidants that neutralize toxins and promote their elimination.

## What are the best natural ways to support liver detoxification?

There are several natural methods to support liver detoxification:

1. Increase your intake of antioxidant-rich foods.
   This can provide your liver with essential nutrients to optimize its detoxification function. Berries, leafy greens, and cruciferous vegetables are rich in antioxidants and should be incorporated into your diet.

2. Staying hydrated is crucial for liver function.
   Drinking enough water helps flush out toxins and ensure optimal liver performance.

3. Reduce alcohol consumption.
   Excessive alcohol intake can cause serious damage to the liver, so it's advisable to limit or avoid alcohol altogether.

4. Incorporate liver-supportive herbs into your diet.
   Milk thistle, dandelion root, and turmeric have long been used to support liver health and aid in detoxification.

5. Cut back on processed foods.

## Tips Before You Get Started on Meal Prepping

### Setting Clear Goals:
Before diving into meal prepping, it's crucial to define your health and fitness goals. Are you looking to shed a few pounds, gain muscle, or simply adopt a healthier lifestyle? Having clear objectives will guide your meal prep choices and keep you on track.

### Gathering the Right Tools:
A well-equipped kitchen is a meal prepper's best friend. Invest in high-quality food storage containers, a sharp set of knives, measuring cups, and a reliable food scale. These tools will not only make meal prepping more efficient but also ensure that your prepped meals stay fresh longer.

---

## Planning Your Meals:

Meal planning is the bedrock of successful meal prepping. Spend some time creating a weekly meal plan that includes breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. This plan will serve as your roadmap, ensuring that you stay focused on your health and fitness goals throughout the week.

### Balancing Variety and Nutrition:
Variety is not only the spice of life but also the key to a well-rounded diet. Ensure your meal plan incorporates a diverse range of foods to avoid dietary boredom and provide your body with a wide array of nutrients. Balance your macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) to suit your specific needs and preferences.

---

## Taking Inventory

Before you embark on your meal prepping journey, it's essential to assess your kitchen and pantry. Take inventory to ensure you have all the necessary items on hand:

---

## Kitchen and Pantry Assessment

Start by examining your kitchen and pantry. What ingredients do you already have, and what do you need to restock?

Create a checklist of essential items such as spices, canned goods, grains, and staples that you'll use frequently in your meal prepping endeavors.

### Organizing Your Kitchen Space
A well-organized kitchen makes meal prepping more enjoyable and efficient. Clear out clutter and organize your workspace to ensure everything is within easy reach.

---

## Tips on Meal Planning and Prepping

### Creating a Weekly Meal Plan

Meal planning provides structure to your meal prepping efforts. Consider the following tips for crafting a successful meal plan:

- Include a variety of foods to ensure balanced nutrition.
- Consider your schedule and plan simpler meals on busy days.
- Prepare a shopping list based on your meal plan to avoid last-minute grocery store trips.

---

### Portion Control and Packaging

Portion control is vital for managing your calorie intake and achieving your fitness goals. Invest in portion-controlled containers to help you maintain the right serving sizes. These containers not only simplify storage but also make it easier to grab and go.

## Understanding Macronutrients

So, before we jump straight into the counting, let's get clear on what 'macronutrients' actually are. In simple terms, they're the main nutrients our bodies need in good amounts to stay energised and healthy. We're talking about proteins, fats, and carbs here, each serving unique roles and supplying distinct benefits:

1. **Proteins**: Proteins are crucial for tissue repair, immune function, and muscle development.

2. **Fats**: Fats support cell structure, hormone production, and nutrient absorption.

3. **Carbohydrates**: Carbohydrates are the body’s primary energy source, fueling our everyday activities.

## The Benefits of Counting Macros

Counting macros, also known as macronutrient counting, facilitates a balanced intake of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. It provides numerous advantages, including:

- **Weight Management**: It aids individuals in achieving weight loss, maintenance, or gain objectives, depending on personal goals.

- **Enhanced Nutrient Intake**: It promotes a diverse and balanced diet, ensuring the body receives essential nutrients.

- **Improved Athletic Performance**: Athletes can tailor their macro intake to support their training regimen and boost performance.

- **Greater Dietary Flexibility**: It allows for flexible food choices if they fit within the allocated macro limits.

# Halloween Health Facts

Halloween emerges from the shadows, bringing with it a sense of mystery and excitement. While ghouls and ghosts may be the stars of the season, there are some health-related facts that can send shivers down your spine. Get ready to be both spooked and educated with these 10 eerie and astonishing health facts that perfectly suit the Halloween air.

## 1. Cannibalistic Calories
Throughout its lifetime, the average person unintentionally consumes around 70,000 small particles, which include microscopic bits of food, bugs, and even human skin. It's like having a bite of yourself now and then.

## 2. Cemetery of Dead Skin
The outer layer of your skin sheds continuously, with about 30,000 to 40,000 cells falling off every minute. Over a year, you'd shed enough skin cells to fill a creepy coffin.

## 3. Spine-Chilling Sneeze Particles
A single sneeze can release up to 40,000 droplets into the air, each containing potentially infectious particles. That's like a microscopic Halloween confetti explosion.

## 4. Hair-Raising Shedding
People lose about 50 to 100 hairs from their scalp every day. In a year, that's enough hair to make a creepy wig!

## 5. Zombie Cells
Just like the undead, our bodies can harbor "zombie cells" known as senescent cells. These cells are alive but no longer function properly, and they can accumulate with age, contributing to inflammation and various age-related diseases.

## 6. Eerie Entropy
The human body generates heat even after death, causing it to decompose and break down. It's a grim reminder of our own mortality.

## 7. Bony Chills
Babies are born with around 300 bones, but as they grow, some bones fuse together. By the time you're an adult, you'll have about 206 bones – it's like your skeleton is getting into the spirit of Halloween and assembling itself.

## 8. Ghoulish Germs
Your cellphone can harbor more germs than a toilet seat. It's like carrying a little petri dish of spookiness in your pocket!

## 9. Vampiric Vitamin D Deficiency
Vitamin D, often called the "sunshine vitamin," is crucial for bone health. But did you know that a deficiency can lead to weak, brittle bones and an increased risk of fractures? It's like a vampire's nightmare.

## 10. Haunting Headaches
The brain itself can't feel pain, but the surrounding tissues, blood vessels, and nerves can. That pounding headache might feel like a ghost haunting your skull.

As you indulge in Halloween festivities...

### Post-Workout Nutrition Importance after HIIT Training

Post-workout nutrition is crucial for muscle recovery and growth after high-intensity interval training (HIIT) for several reasons. HIIT workouts are intense and demand a lot from your body, and what you consume after the workout can significantly impact your recovery and overall fitness progress.

#### Here's why post-workout nutrition is important after HIIT training:

- **Muscle Recovery and Repair**
  HIIT workouts often involve intense muscle contractions and microtears in the muscle fibers. Consuming the right nutrients post-workout provides your body with the building blocks it needs to repair and rebuild muscle tissues. Protein is essential for [muscle recovery](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/diet-and-nutrition/the-importance-of-protein-for-endurance-athletes) as it provides amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins.

- **Glycogen Replenishment**
  HIIT workouts can deplete your glycogen stores, which are the primary energy source for high-intensity exercise. Consuming [carbohydrates](https://www.vpa.com.au/collections/carbohydrates) after your workout helps replenish these glycogen stores, ensuring you have the energy you need for future workouts and daily activities.

- **Reduced Muscle Soreness**
  HIIT can lead to muscle soreness and inflammation. Proper post-workout nutrition can help reduce the severity and duration of muscle soreness by providing anti-inflammatory nutrients, antioxidants, and hydration.

- **Improved Performance**
  Adequate post-workout nutrition can enhance your overall performance during subsequent workouts. When your body is properly fueled and recovered, you're more likely to perform at your best and achieve better results in your HIIT sessions.

- **Muscle Protein Synthesis**
  Consuming protein after HIIT training stimulates muscle protein synthesis, the process by which your body builds new muscle proteins. This is essential for muscle growth and adaptation to exercise.

- **Reduced Risk of Overtraining**
  HIIT can be physically demanding and place stress on your body. Proper post-workout nutrition can help reduce the risk of overtraining, which can lead to fatigue, injury, and decreased performance.

Blood sugar, also known as blood glucose, can spike for various reasons. This can have both short-term and long-term effects on health and sports performance, but most especially affects individuals with diabetes or those at risk of developing diabetes.

Understanding the causes, symptoms, and effective prevention methods is crucial for maintaining stable blood sugar levels and overall well-being. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore the various aspects of managing blood sugar spikes, including diet, exercise, stress management, hydration, and more.

## Understanding blood sugar spikes

A blood sugar spike occurs when there is an increase in the levels of glucose in the blood. While it can happen to anyone, individuals with diabetes are more susceptible. When the body fails to produce enough insulin or properly use insulin, glucose accumulates in the bloodstream, leading to hyperglycemia. This can result from factors such as an unhealthy diet, a sedentary lifestyle, medication non-compliance, stress, or inadequate sleep.

### What causes blood sugar to spike?

- **Dietary factors**
  - **Consuming carbohydrates:** Carbohydrate-rich foods and beverages are the primary sources of glucose in the diet. Eating foods high in carbohydrates, especially those with a high glycemic index (e.g., sugary snacks, white bread, rice, and sugary drinks), can lead to a rapid increase in blood sugar levels.
  - **Overeating:** Consuming large portions of any type of food, including carbohydrates, can cause a surge in blood sugar as the body works to process the excess glucose.

- **Insufficient insulin or insulin resistance:** Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that helps regulate blood sugar levels by facilitating the uptake of glucose into cells.

Blood sugar can spike when:

In individuals with **type 1 diabetes**, the pancreas doesn't produce insulin, so they need to take insulin injections or use an insulin pump to manage their blood sugar.

In individuals with **type 2 diabetes**, the body's cells become resistant to insulin's actions, making it difficult for glucose to enter the cells. This can result in elevated blood sugar levels.

- **Stress and hormonal changes**

# What are the 4 Pillars of Biohacking?

While there is a wider range of principles for biohacking, practitioners and experts all agree on these four key pillars of biohacking for health and wellness and high performance.

**Nutrition:** This pillar focuses on optimising your diet to support your physical and mental well-being. Biohackers often experiment with various diets, supplements, and eating patterns to find what works best for them. Nutrient-dense foods, personalised nutrition plans, and mindful eating are central components of this pillar.

**Sleep Optimisation:** Quality sleep is essential for recovery, cognitive function, overall health, and peak performance. Biohackers prioritise [improving their sleep quality](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/the-importance-of-sleep-is-sleep-the-reason-you-re-not-seeing-results-in-the-gym) and duration through practices like creating a sleep-conducive environment, managing stress, practising good [sleep hygiene](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/sleep-hygiene), and using sleep tracking technology to monitor sleep patterns.

**Movement:** This pillar emphasises the role of regular exercise and physical activity in optimising health and performance. Biohackers customise their fitness routines to meet their specific goals, whether it's improving strength, endurance, flexibility, or overall well-being. They may also incorporate high-intensity interval training (HIIT), resistance training, and other exercise modalities.

**Stress Management and Mental Health:** Managing stress and mental well-being is considered a crucial pillar of biohacking. Techniques like meditation, [cold exposure therapy](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/training/the-benefits-of-the-wim-hof-method), [deep breathing exercise](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/importance-of-diaphragmatic-breathing), [mindfulness](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/the-key-to-mindfulness-and-mental-fitness-benefits-and-the-importance-of-meditation), and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are often used to reduce stress, enhance focus, and promote mental resilience. Biohackers may also explore and utilise wearable devices and biofeedback tools to track your progress and optimise your training.

Ah, the dreaded belly bloat. We've all been there – that uncomfortable feeling of puffiness in your stomach that can leave you feeling self-conscious and sluggish. But fear not, fellow bloat-battlers! There are ways to combat this common woe and reclaim your flat-feeling belly.

Belly bloat isn’t just an aesthetic concern—it can also be quite uncomfortable. Whether it's the result of a large meal, hormonal fluctuations, or certain digestive disorders, many people experience bloating and seek effective remedies. If you've been wondering how to reduce bloating through targeted exercises and specific dietary changes, this detailed guide is tailored for you. Here, we will explore practical strategies to help alleviate belly bloat and promote a healthier digestive system.

This article talks about the causes of belly bloat and explores simple yet effective strategies to get you back on track. We'll cover exercises, dietary tweaks, and lifestyle changes that can help you de-bloat and feel your best.

---

### Understanding the Why Behind the Sigh: What Causes Belly Bloat?

Belly bloat can be caused by a variety of factors, some more serious than others. Here are some common culprits:

- **Gas and Constipation:** When your digestive system struggles to break down food or move things along smoothly, gas and stool can build up, leading to bloating. This can be triggered by certain foods, stress, or even a lack of fiber in your diet.
- **Food Intolerances:** Lactose intolerance, for example, can cause bloating after consuming dairy products because your body lacks the enzyme lactase to break down lactose sugar.

---

### Exercises to the Rescue: How Movement Can Ease Belly Bloat

Exercise is a fantastic tool for reducing belly bloat in several ways. Here's how:

- **Aids Digestion:** Physical activity helps stimulate your digestive system, promoting smoother movement of food and gas, leading to less bloating.
- **Reduces Stress:** Stress can be a major contributor to bloating. Exercise is a natural stress reliever, helping to relax your muscles and ease bloating caused by tension.
- **Improves Gut Health:** Regular exercise has been shown to promote the growth of good bacteria in your gut, which can contribute to better digestion and reduced bloating.

---

### So, what exercises are best for de-bloating?

Exercise is a powerful tool for managing bloating. It improves the motility of the digestive tract and can help gas pass more quickly, reducing discomfort. Here’s how to incorporate exercise into your routine to target bloating:

- **Core Workouts:** Strengthening your core helps support the entire digestive tract. Incorporate exercises like planks, Russian twists, and leg raises into your routine. Not only do these exercises tighten your abdominal muscles, but they also stimulate intestinal action, which helps relieve bloating.
- **Cardiovascular Exercises:** Engaging in regular cardiovascular exercise such as brisk walking, cycling, or aerobic classes increases heart rate and breathing, helping to naturally massage your digestive tract and enhance gas expulsion.

Feeling a bit flat before hitting the gym?

Don’t worry, legends! We’ll get you sorted with our top 10 best foods to eat before a workout because what you eat beforehand makes a world of difference. Forget sad salads and wilted celery sticks – we're talking about pre-workout snacks that are as delicious as they are energising. So, chuck another snag on the barbie (well, maybe not literally before a workout) and listen up close! Here are the top 10 pre-workout snacks guaranteed to turn you into a gym legend.

**Remember: Timing is Key!**

Before we dish out delish pre-workout snacks, remember – timing is everything. Ideally, aim to eat your pre-workout snack 1-2 hours before you unleash your inner athlete. This gives your body enough time to digest and convert that food into energy.

The ideal pre-workout snack should be a delightful duet of carbohydrates and protein. Carbs provide sustained energy, while protein helps build and repair muscle. So, let's get this pre-sweat party started!

## 1. The Energising Smoothie Bowl

This beauty is as delicious as it is functional. Blend half a cup of frozen berries with a scoop of [VPA Australia Whey Isolate](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder) (unflavored or choose your favorite flavor!), a splash of unsweetened almond milk, and a dollop of plain Greek yogurt. Pour it into a bowl and top with a sprinkle of granola, a drizzle of honey, and some chia seeds for extra texture.

**Why it works:** This smoothie bowl is a flavor and nutrient explosion. The berries provide a burst of carbs and antioxidants, the whey isolate delivers a protein punch, and the Greek yogurt adds a touch of creaminess and more protein. Granola adds a satisfying crunch, while honey and chia seeds offer a touch of sweetness and healthy fats.

## 2. The Power-Packed Pancakes

Who says pancakes can't be pre-workout fuel? Ditch the sugary syrups and whip up a batch of protein pancakes using [VPA Australia Protein Pancake Mix!](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/protein-pancake-mix/) Add an egg (protein boost!) and some milk for a fluffy batter. Throw in some chopped blueberries for a burst of antioxidants. Cook your pancakes and top them with a drizzle of natural honey for a touch of sweetness.

**Why it's perfect:** Protein pancake mix provides sustained energy (protein), while the egg and blueberries add an extra dose of protein and antioxidants. Honey provides a quick energy source, perfect for that pre-workout push.

## 3. The Scrambled Scramble with a Twist

Scrambled eggs are a classic breakfast option, but let's take it up a notch for pre-workout! Scramble two eggs with chopped spinach and diced red capsicum. Top it with a sprinkle of grated parmesan cheese for a touch of savory goodness.

**Why it's perfect:** Eggs are a complete protein source, meaning they contain all essential amino acids for muscle building and repair. Spinach is rich in iron, which helps deliver oxygen to your muscles, and capsicum provides vitamin C, another important nutrient for exercise performance.

## 4. The "Ant on a Log" Reinvented

Remember that childhood snack – celery sticks with peanut butter? Let's give it a grown-up makeover! Spread some [VPA Australia Protein Mousse](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/protein-mousse-500g/) on celery sticks for a creamy and protein-rich base. Top it with some sliced almonds for a delightful crunch and healthy fats.

**Why it's perfect:** Celery provides hydration, while protein mousse delivers a sustained energy source. Almonds offer healthy fats and fiber, keeping you feeling fuller for longer.

## 5. The Powerhouse Pita

Whole wheat pita bread is a fantastic base for a pre-workout snack. Fill it with some shredded chicken breast (lean protein!), sliced cucumber and tomato (hydration!), and a dollop of hummus (healthy fats and fiber).

**Why it's perfect:** Chicken breast provides readily available protein, while the veggies keep you hydrated. Hummus adds healthy fats and fiber, keeping you feeling full and focused during your workout.

# What is Whey Protein Made From?

Whey protein comes from milk. Milk is separated into curds (used to make cheese) and liquid whey during the cheese-making process. This liquid whey is then filtered and dried to create whey protein powder.

# Natural lactose content in whey

Does whey protein have lactose? Since whey comes from milk, it naturally contains lactose, a sugar found in dairy products. How much lactose remains in your whey protein depends on the processing method used, and that’s where the different types of whey come into the picture.

# Does Whey Protein Contain Lactose?

The lactose content in [whey protein](https://www.vpa.com.au/collections/whey-protein) varies depending on the type:

## Whey Protein Concentrate (WPC) – Higher in Lactose

[Whey Protein Concentrate (WPC)](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/premium-whey-wpc) is the least processed form of whey. It typically contains 70–80% protein, with the remaining comprising fats, carbohydrates, and lactose. If you're mildly lactose intolerant, WPC may cause digestive issues like bloating, gas, nausea, or discomfort, especially if consumed in large quantities.

## Whey Protein Isolate (WPI) – Much Lower in Lactose

[Whey Protein Isolate (WPI)](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder) undergoes an additional filtration process that removes most fats and carbohydrates, including lactose. Most WPIs contain 90% or more protein and are often labelled as low-lactose or lactose-free protein powder. If you're wondering if whey isolate is lactose-free, the answer is not always, but it comes very close (typically minuscule).

## Hydrolysed Whey – Pre-Digested, Easier on Digestion

Hydrolysed whey is a protein partially broken down into smaller peptides (pre-digested) to improve absorption and reduce the chance of digestive discomfort. While it still contains a small amount of lactose, it is generally well-tolerated by those with mild sensitivities.

## Important Note: Amounts Vary by Brand

Different brands use different filtration methods. Some whey isolate products claim to be 100% lactose-free, while others may still contain trace amounts. Therefore, individuals with severe intolerance should always check the label and look for third-party tested brands that confirm lactose-free certification.

# Can Lactose-Intolerant People Still Use Whey Protein?

Absolutely – but it depends on the severity of your intolerance.

## Mild vs Severe Lactose Intolerance Explained

People with mild lactose intolerance can often tolerate small amounts of lactose without symptoms. They might do fine with high-quality, low-lactose Whey Protein Isolate (WPI) or even small servings of WPC. Those with severe lactose intolerance or a diagnosed dairy allergy, however, need to be more cautious. Even trace amounts of lactose can trigger symptoms like cramping, bloating, diarrhoea, or nausea.

## Many Lactose-Intolerant Individuals Tolerate Whey Isolate

Because WPI is so low in lactose, it’s often well-tolerated. Many lactose-intolerant athletes and gym-goers use whey isolate regularly without any issues.

## Benefits of Choosing High-Quality, Low-Lactose Options

Brands like VPA Australia offer WPI that is certified lactose-free, ensuring purity and peace of mind. Their filtration techniques remove virtually all lactose, making them one of the best protein powder options for sensitive users. Moreover, they are third-party tested.

# Signs You May Be Sensitive to Lactose in Whey Protein

If you’ve been experiencing digestive discomfort after taking whey, you might be reacting to the lactose in your protein powder. Common signs include:

- Bloating
- Stomach cramps
- Gas
- Diarrhoea
- Nausea within 30 minutes to 2 hours after consumption, sometimes leading to vomiting.

Switching to a lactose-free protein powder or whey isolate can help alleviate these symptoms.

# How to Choose a Whey Protein if You're Lactose Intolerant

Not all whey proteins are the same. Here’s how to shop smart:

## Look for "Whey Isolate" on the label

This is the number one thing to look for. Whey isolate (WPI) has undergone extra processing to remove most lactose. It’s your safest bet if you’re lactose sensitive.

## Check lactose content if available

Some brands list lactose content in grams per serving. Aim for less than 0.5g of lactose per serving, or ideally zero if you are intolerant. Ultimately, how much ...
