### Spring Clean Your Nutrition Habits

As the seasons change, why not take the opportunity to give your nutrition habits a fresh start? Spring cleaning isn't just for decluttering your home; it can also be applied to your diet. By making small, sustainable changes and focusing on progress rather than perfection, you can improve your overall health and well-being. In this article, we will explore ten effective strategies for cleaning up your nutritional habits.

1. **START BY ASSESSING YOUR CURRENT NUTRITION HABITS**
Before embarking on any dietary changes, it's essential to evaluate your current eating patterns. Take a close look at what you're currently consuming and identify areas that need improvement. Are you eating enough fruits and vegetables? Are you consuming too many processed or sugary foods? By identifying your strengths and weaknesses, you can create a targeted plan for improvement.

2. **Set realistic goals**
Instead of attempting a complete diet overhaul, focus on making small, sustainable changes. Setting unrealistic expectations can lead to frustration and a higher chance of giving up. Start by identifying one or two areas where you can make manageable changes and build from there. For example, if you currently skip breakfast, set a goal to incorporate a healthy breakfast into your routine three times a week.

3. **Clean out your pantry and fridge**
To eliminate temptations and set yourself up for success, it's crucial to remove any unhealthy snacks or processed foods from your pantry and fridge. Donate or discard items that do not align with your nutrition goals. Instead, stock up on healthier alternatives such as whole-grain snacks, nuts, and seeds.

4. **Stock up on healthy staples**
A well-stocked kitchen makes it easier to maintain a healthy diet. Ensure your fridge and pantry are filled with nutritious options like fresh fruits and vegetables, lean proteins (such as chicken breast or tofu), whole grains (like quinoa or brown rice), and healthy fats (such as avocados or olive oil). Having these staples readily available will make it simpler to prepare nourishing meals.

5. **Plan your meals ahead of time**
Meal planning and preparation can help you stick to your new nutrition habits. By dedicating time each week to plan your meals and prepare ingredients in advance, you'll be less likely to make impulsive, unhealthy choices. Consider creating a [weekly meal plan](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/3-ways-to-meal-prep-and-cut-down-cooking-time) and grocery shopping list, and preparing some meals ahead of time to save time and make healthier eating more convenient.
