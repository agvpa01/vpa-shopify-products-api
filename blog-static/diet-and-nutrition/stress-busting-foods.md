## Stress and Anxiety

Stress is a normal biological response to a perceived challenge or demand. In short bursts, it is completely healthy and forces the body to adapt and overcome. However, when stress is prolonged, it is detrimental to our health and associated with numerous chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, dementia, and mental health conditions such as anxiety syndrome. The American Psychological Association (APA) defines anxiety as “an emotion characterized by feelings of tension, worried thoughts and physical changes like increased blood pressure.” It is estimated that ~14% of adults and ~7% of children experience generalized anxiety disorder, making it one of the most common of all mental health conditions. 

We’ve all felt stress and anxiety at some point in our lives. A racing heart, a flushed face, queasiness in our stomach; it’s not a feeling that is enjoyed. Frustratingly, stress and anxiety are not always produced by genuine threats, which means that everyday activities can cause us anxiety. This includes things like important events, starting a new job, waiting for an important call, speaking in front of people (in fact a survey once found that people were more afraid of public speaking than death), and sometimes anxiety is caused by no obvious reason at all.

### What actually happens when we feel stressed or anxious?

Well, first the brain receives a stressful input at the hypothalamus, then it communicates with a gland at the base of the brain called the pituitary gland. This gland produces important stress hormones, which then stimulate other important glands on top of the kidneys called the adrenal glands. This pathway is called the HPA axis and is our major stress pathway. At this point, more hormones are produced which then cause stress responses such as increased blood pressure, increased fat and glucose production, protein breakdown, constriction of blood vessels, increased respiration, and pupil dilation. This is called the fight or flight response.

### Men and women experience and deal with stress differently

Men tend to experience stress more strongly, partly because women produce more oxytocin, which offsets the effects of cortisol and epinephrine (powerful stress hormones produced by the adrenal glands). Women also have stronger innate immune systems, making them more resilient to stress but placing them at increased risk for autoimmune diseases. Women also tend to deal with stress differently, seeking support and relationships during periods of stress and anxiety, whereas men tend to deal with stress in a true fight or flight manner (bottle it up, try and escape or fight back).
