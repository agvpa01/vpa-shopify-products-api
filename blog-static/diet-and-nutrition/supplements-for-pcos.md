# PCOS Nutrition and Supplements

When it comes to PCOS, it is highly recommended to prioritize your overall nutrition. However, there are a few supplements that can help. Here is a list provided by Accredited Practising Dietitian, Aidan Muir.

## When it comes to PCOS

When it comes to PCOS, quite a few supplements can help. [Prioritising your overall nutrition](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/proper-nutrition-in-2022) will help far more than any individual supplement, but supplements can certainly provide some value.

When it comes to supplements, often they are only beneficial whenever there is a deficiency or inadequate intake. Adding the supplement in addition to an already optimal intake likely won’t provide any additional benefit. So, keep that in mind since a lot of these needs can be met through food as well. Supplements are just the icing on the cake. If you would like to learn more about nutrition in general for PCOS, [I recommend reading this post](https://idealnutrition.com.au/nutrition-for-pcos-a-dietitians-guide).

PCOS can’t technically be cured, but these might help reduce symptoms related to menstruation, excess hair growth, ovulation, fertility, testosterone, insulin resistance and many more.

## Inositol

There is a lot of solid evidence for how Inositol can help people with PCOS. It appears to improve [insulin sensitivity, lower testosterone and aid fertility](http://www.europeanreview.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/1896-1903.pdf).

The recommended dosage is 2-4g per day of Myo-inositol.

## Omega 3's

Omega 3’s can help reduce inflammation and improve metabolic markers such as cholesterol and blood pressure. It may also help [reduce testosterone and help with the regularity of the menstrual cycle](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3941370).

Ideally, you would obtain this through food by consuming fish 2-3 times per week (at least one time is oily fish such as salmon) or consuming plant-based options such as seeds or walnuts.

The recommended dosage is 1000-3000mg daily if you are supplementing.

## Cinnamon

Cinnamon may help under certain circumstances. It can potentially help [menstrual cycle irregularities](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24813595). It can also [aid blood glucose](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17296187) control by improving glucose use in cells and slowing the rate at which glucose enters the blood.

The recommended dosage is 1-2g per day.

## Zinc

Zinc can be effective for [reducing hair growth or reducing hair loss](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26315303?log$=activity) associated with PCOS. It can also potentially help [reduce insulin resistance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6250088).

The dosage used in research is 50mg/per day, which is significantly higher than the RDI of 8mg/day. For reference, most people do not reach the RDI consistently through food.

---

## Magnesium

Magnesium can help [improve insulin sensitivity and, if taken at night, reduce fasting blood glucose levels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21205110) (BGL's).

The recommended dosage is 300-400mg, taken one hour before going to bed. However, I would wager that this won't be necessary if you meet your magnesium needs through foods. Though, the vast majority of people do not meet the RDI for magnesium through food. Therefore this potentially could be helpful for quite a few people.

## N-acetylcystein (NAC)

A bit of research indicates that NAC may lead to [improvements in pregnancy and ovulation rates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4306416). This is a bit of a watch in this space area, though, as the evidence isn’t very strong yet.

NAC increases the cellular levels of antioxidants and reduces glutathione at higher doses. Theoretically, this can translate to improved insulin sensitivity, but the current research doesn’t support that in practice.

The dosage commonly used in research is 1200-1800mg per day.

## Berberine

Berberine is a compound extracted from various plants traditionally used in Chinese medicine. It has been studied for its potential in treating various conditions, including PCOS. Some research suggests that berberine may help improve insulin sensitivity, reduce testosterone levels, and regulate the menstrual cycle in women with PCOS.

The recommended dosage of berberine varies depending on the specific condition being treated, but typical doses range from 900-1500mg per day.
