### What is beetroot powder?

Beetroot powder is made by drying concentrated beetroot juice at low temperatures and crushing it into a powder. It is sold as either capsules, or as a powder.

Beetroot powder is the superior form and we will explain why below. Beetroot powder is a natural but potent source of nitrate. If you are seeking performance benefits, beetroot powder is better than simply consuming beetroot. Why? To obtain a clinical dose of nitrate from beetroot juice, you would have to juice enough beets to produce almost a litre of juice.

If you’re into juicing, you know that you’d have to juice a LOT of beetroots to product that much juice. So beetroot powder provides a quick, convenient source of nitrate.

### What is Nitrate?

Nitrate is a [naturally occurring organic compound](https://examine.com/supplements/nitrate/) of nitrogen and oxygen which has the chemical formula NO3-. It occurs naturally in many natural foods we eat, especially leafy greens like spinach, silverbeet and even bok choy. Beetroot is a particularly good source of naturally occurring nitrate.  Within our body, nitrate is converted into nitric oxide and it is nitric oxide that has performance enhancing effects on our body.

### How should I take beetroot powder?

One serve of BEET 500 is 25g and this provides you with 500mg of nitrate.  Ideally, 500mg of nitrate should be consumed around 30 minutes before training or competing for maximum benefit. Heavier people may require a [larger dose](https://examine.com/supplements/nitrate/), and this can be adjusted by adding another 1/2 or full dose. Due to it’s strong beetroot flavour, Beet 500 should be taken on it’s own with water and not mixed with other flavoured products. You could add other unflavoured amino acids to it if you would like.

BEET 500 may have two mild side effects. The first is that for those with FODMAPS intolerance, it may cause mild digestive issues. This side effect is rare, but we would always recommend that endurance athletes trial Beet 500 in training and never for the first time on race day. Beetroot powder may also cause pink coloured urine and stools as the beetroot pigments are processed from our bodies.

So there you have it, a summary of the benefits of beetroot powder to both sports performance and health.  Beet 500 really is a supplement that can benefit all people!
