# Gut-Brain Connection

Do you remember a time when you experienced butterflies in your stomach? That feeling is associated with a strong emotion (anxiety, nervousness, or even love). This common sensation is caused by our gut-brain connection. Learn more about the gut and brain connection, its effects on our body, and how we can improve our overall health by taking care of our gut health.

Do you remember a time when you experienced butterflies in your stomach? I had a crazy bout of butterflies just today, thanks to my new research project! But this is completely normal, and we all experience it at some time or other. Butterflies are usually associated with a strong emotion (anxiety, nervousness, or even love) and can be so strong that they leave us feeling nauseated. Despite not always being a welcoming experience, this common sensation is caused by our gut-brain connection.

## Gut-brain axis

The communication system between the gut and brain is called the gut-brain axis. This axis is a bi-directional, complex biochemical and physical pathway. There are approximately 500 million neurons (nerve cells) in our gut that communicate with the brain via the vagus nerve (the longest cranial nerve), the endocrine system (responsible for producing hormones), and neurotransmitters (molecules used by the nervous system to transmit messages). What is super interesting about the neurotransmitters is that some of them are also produced in the gut, including our sleep-promoting neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and our feel-good neurotransmitters, serotonin and dopamine. This means that what is happening in our gut directly influences our feelings and vice versa.

Excitingly, there is new research investigating the role of the gut-brain axis in association with mood and psychological disorders, in addition to many other chronic diseases. With an estimated 45% of Australians experiencing a mental health condition in their lifetime (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2008), there has never been a more important time to understand this connection.

## Microbiota gut-brain axis

More recently, it has been discovered that there is an additional factor to gut health, which is our gut microbiota. Microbiota refers to microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi that inhabit our gut. These tiny little organisms are not only important but are, in fact necessary for life.

The human gut is a diverse and complex community with around 10^14 bacteria, the main gut microbe. Research has shown that bacteria can metabolize other substances that also have an impact on how our brain functions. Bacterial fermentation of fiber produces butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid with important brain benefits such as improved memory, cognitive flexibility, nerve growth (in an injured brain), and improved mood. The microbiota also plays a crucial role in the immune system and inflammatory processes, which are important in disease prevention. However, if the immune system is stimulated for too long, it can lead to inflammation, which is associated with a number of brain disorders, including depression and Alzheimer’s.

The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a rapidly growing area of interest. In addition to the association between our mental health and dysbiosis (microbial imbalance), recent studies have also found associations with metabolic syndrome, diabetes, heart disease, Crohn’s, Ulcerative colitis, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

It’s unclear about the exact pathogenesis (disease progression), but “when the balance of intestinal microbiota is broken, the intestinal defense function and immunoregulatory function are decreased, the immunity of the body is reduced, and the relative pathogenic factors are increased so as to cause the intestinal mucosal invasion or aggravate the diseases.”

## Gut health

As scientists discover more about the microbiota-gut-brain axis, they are also able to identify how we can improve our gut health. It is now established that the ratio of “good” to “bad” bacteria has significant effects on our physical and mental well-being. There are a number of things that upset the balance of bacteria in our gut, including:

- Stress
- Chronic disease
- Acute illness
- Oral contraceptive pill
- Anti-inflammatories
- Aspirin
- Heavy alcohol consumption
- Antibiotics
- Poor quality diet (especially one that is high in sugar, low in fiber)
- Lack of exercise
- Lack of quality sleep
- Smoking
