## Myth 1: Carbs are bad for you

It seems that carbs have replaced fats as the enemy of a healthy diet. Many people believe the healthiness of foods are based on their glycemic index, although research on low-glycemic diets show little evidence (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) even for diabetics (8, 9, 10). This lack of evidence is also found for the carbohydrate-insulin model of obesity, which says that obesity is caused by the insulin response they carbohydrates create (11,12).

These findings are also found with long-term keto diets that test real-world effectiveness. Meta-analyses reveal that they do not provide clinically relevant weight loss differences when compared to higher-carb diets (13,14).

We are not saying that cutting carbs intake cannot be helpful, especially processed carbs, we think it can be especially if it leads to healthier eating choices. But if cutting carbs makes you feel bad and eventually eat worse because you can not stick to it then you should find a diet that works for you.

## Myth 2: Red meat is bad for you

Now we’ve all; heard that statement that red meat causes cancer. Now, this is difficult because almost everything we eat has the potential to cause or be involved with the growth of cancer cells (15). Evidence suggests that highly processed meats especially when charred during cooking are a risk for cancer when combined with poor lifestyles (16,17), but a healthy diet which consists of quality red meats is not something to worry about.

## Myth 3: Salt is bad for you

We have all heard that salt is bad for you and there are even studies which support this notion (18, 19, 20). But what a lot of people don’t realise is that salt (sodium) is an essential mineral which is critical to optimal health, it is when you consume too much sodium that is the problem.

Salt is essential to your health, but most people consume too much of it. That's because it's added to so many foods, including processed foods and restaurant meals.

The recommended daily amount of salt is 2,300 mg per day. Most Americans eat about 3,400 mg per day.

High blood pressure is a risk factor for heart disease, stroke and kidney disease. If you have high blood pressure, reducing your intake of sodium can help lower your blood pressure.

If you want to cut back on salt, use less when cooking or buy low-sodium products from the grocery store. You may need to taste food before adding salt as some dishes might not need as much as you think they do!

## Myth 4: Bread is bad for everyone

Bread is now associated with gluten and getting fat. Now bread itself won’t make you fat, but it is high in calories and is very easy to consume. There is also the issue of condiments that many people eat with bread being high in fat and sugar, both again high in calories.  Gluten critics claim that any amount of gluten is bad for anyone. Yes, for some people gluten can be harmful but not all (21, 22).

If the calories and macros from bread fit into your healthy balanced diet and it doesn’t cause any irritability or an allergic reaction than it is fine to consume in reasonable amounts.

## Myth 5: Fresh is more nutritious than frozen

Frozen food is generally grouped with canned food, and seen as less desirable than fresh food. But overall they are very similar. But what many people do not realise is that frozen produce may actually have more nutritional value because of the process it undergoes before freezing. Frozen produce undergoes blanching in hot water for a few minutes before freezing to inactivate enzymes that cause unfavourable changes nutritional value (23).

## Myth 6: Food nutrients are always superior to supplemental nutrients

Most people would assume that food nutrients are better than supplements, but it is not always the case. For example the curcumin in turmeric, On its own your body cannot absorb it very well but taken in liposomal form or supplemented with piperine, it’s absorption increases dramatically (24). Similar examples can also be found for Vitamin K1 and Vitamin B9.

## Myth 7: Eat more often to boost your metabolism

Now this one is a strong myth that has been around for a long time. Now although digestion does increase your metabolism, it doesn’t matter how many meals you have, if the amount of food is the same throughout the day your body will still burn the same amount of calories (25).

## Myth 8: You need to eat breakfast

Many people think that breakfast is important because it boosts your metabolism for the day and skipping it can crash your metabolism. But studies in both overweight and healthy people show that skipping breakfast does not inherently affect your metabolism negatively (26, 27).

Eating breakfast will not help you lose weight or reduce your hunger. It may even increase your risk for obesity if it turns into a sugary pastry or other calorie-rich option that leaves you feeling even hungrier later in the day.
