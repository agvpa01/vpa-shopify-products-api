# What are the 4 Pillars of Biohacking?

While there is a wider range of principles for biohacking, practitioners and experts all agree on these four key pillars of biohacking for health and wellness and high performance.

## Nutrition:
This pillar focuses on optimising your diet to support your physical and mental well-being. Biohackers often experiment with various diets, supplements, and eating patterns to find what works best for them. Nutrient-dense foods, personalised nutrition plans, and mindful eating are central components of this pillar.

## Sleep Optimisation:
Quality sleep is essential for recovery, cognitive function, overall health, and peak performance. Biohackers prioritise improving their sleep quality and duration through practices like creating a sleep-conducive environment, managing stress, practising good sleep hygiene, and using sleep tracking technology to monitor sleep patterns.

## Movement:
This pillar emphasises the role of regular exercise and physical activity in optimising health and performance. Biohackers customise their fitness routines to meet their specific goals, whether it's improving strength, endurance, flexibility, or overall well-being. They may also incorporate high-intensity interval training (HIIT), resistance training, and other exercise modalities.

## Stress Management and Mental Health:
Managing stress and mental well-being is considered a crucial pillar of biohacking. Techniques like meditation, cold exposure therapy, deep breathing exercise, mindfulness, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are often used to reduce stress, enhance focus, and promote mental resilience. Biohackers may also explore and utilise wearable devices and biofeedback tools to track your progress and optimise your training.
