Here is your guide to the Sunshine Vitamin – Vitamin D. Most of us have heard of Vitamin D and know that it comes from sunlight, hence the name the Sunshine Vitamin.

### Vitamin D

Vitamin D otherwise known as the ‘Sunshine Vitamin’ isn’t actually a vitamin, it’s a hormone. Put simply the body can synthesize Vitamin D, with help from sunlight, from a precursor the body makes from cholesterol.

### Sources of Vitamin D

The main source of the sunshine vitamin is exposure to sunlight. The Sunshine Vitamin is not found naturally in many foods; it is added to some products and is available as a dietary supplement. Meaning food alone cannot provide most people with necessary levels of this vitamin. However, consumption of certain foods can help increase vitamin levels in the body.

Foods that contain Vitamin D include:
- Eggs
- Fatty fish
- Mushrooms (hint: leave the mushrooms in the sun for 2-3 hours (gill side up) before cooking to get the most benefit you can!)
- Fortified foods, such as margarine and milk
- Supplements, such as VPA®'s own [Multi Greens](/products/multi-greens)

### How much sunlight do I need?

Sunlight accounts for more than 80% of the Sunshine Vitamin in our body. There is no easy answer to this question as it depends on a number of factors including where you live, season, time of day, your skin color, and the amount of skin exposed to the sun.

Generally speaking in the cooler times of year you need more sun exposure as only your arms, hands, and possibly your face are exposed to the sun.

As you can see it is quite simple to still get our Vitamin D levels up to ensure we stay healthy during winter.
