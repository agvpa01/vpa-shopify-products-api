### We love a New Year as it symbolizes a fresh start and a clean slate that offers so much potential for growth and success. The result of our year is entirely up to us, and this is the reason why we take the time to reflect and come up with New Year’s Resolutions.

So, as you are coming up with amazing goals to crush like eating healthier, or losing or gaining weight, we have a few more healthy goals to consider adding to your list to make the year more enriching as well as productive.

#### Quick tip: Take the time to reflect on past resolutions.

Consider what kind of goals you’re setting. This year, be mindful of how you state them and come up with actionable plans and make sure you enjoy them. Breaking up large goals like “I want to lose weight” into “I want to exercise three times a week” sets you up for success that’s within reach and reasonable.

### 1. Try a new style of fitness each month

One thing that causes most of us to fail miserably with our fitness resolutions is that we set ourselves up with routines that may work for others but may not be as enjoyable to us. Or you may have found yourself constantly plateauing easily and getting bored with the same routine that you’ve been doing for the past years.

This year, consider exploring new workout styles each month if you haven’t already. This could spark a new interest and motivate you to push yourself further than before.

#### Some activities you may want to try:
- Yoga
- Pilates
- HIIT
- Circuit Training
- Strength Training
- Cardio Training
- Weight Training

### 2. Take time for self-care

Schedule regular alone times for self-care at least once a month to welcome some introspection and decompression. We are often the last person on our priority list when our lives are muddled with work and family responsibilities. Being reminded of putting yourself first can have a massive beneficial impact on your physical and mental health. You can spend time doing these activities you’ve always wanted to try but never had the time to, or simply planning a relaxing day at home for rest and enjoying a cuppa tea.
