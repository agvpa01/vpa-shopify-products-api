### Make dieting easier and crush your hunger

---

### 1) Focus on losing fat at a slowly

By cutting too many calories you will lose your lean muscle along with the fat, and be a lot more hungry than necessary. Focus on creating a small calorie deficit that gradually strips the fat away while maintaining your lean muscle and keeping your hunger levels relatively controlled. Maintain a small calorie deficit of about 15-20% below your maintenance level.

You can't out-train a bad diet. If you eat too much, you'll gain weight. If you eat too little, you'll lose muscle and slow down your metabolism. So if you're trying to lose weight, focus on eating less and exercising more â€” not the other way around. One pound per week is ideal because it can be achieved without too much effort, but it's still fast enough to notice results quickly (a few weeks).

### 2) Consume around 1 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight daily.

This will also ensure you maintain lean muscle, plus protein is much lower in calories than the other two macronutrients, fats and carbs.

Protein helps to build muscle mass, which can increase your metabolism and help you burn more calories. Aim to get 20-30% of your calories from protein in order to maintain or build muscle mass.
