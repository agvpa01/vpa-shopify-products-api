# Plant-Based Protein Powders

Plant-based or vegan protein powders are becoming increasingly popular as an alternative to whey and soy protein powders. Protein powders have been a staple in most health-conscious individuals' diets because they can provide a quick way of getting nutrients after a workout. They also make it easy for people who don't have time to cook and eat healthy food.

If you are on a vegan diet, lactose intolerant, or simply want an alternative to whey, here are three reasons why you should opt for a plant-based protein instead:

## #1 Plant-Based Powders Are More Compatible With Your Dietary Needs

The use of plant-based powders is growing with the rise of veganism, vegetarianism, and health professionals advocating for a [plant-based diet](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/5-foods-that-are-unexpectedly-good-sources-of-protein). The latest trend in plant-based diets is to consume higher quantities of whole foods, such as vegetables and fruits. This has led to a demand for healthier alternatives with traditional animal-based powders.

Years back, there were rarely any choices for people with strict vegan diets in protein supplements. Thankfully, there are a lot in the market today. More people have recognized that these plant-based powders are generally healthier than their animal-derived counterparts.

With these powders, you can enjoy the nutrients you need without worrying about the adverse side effects of consuming animal products. In this way, you get all the benefits of protein without guilt.

Whey protein is derived from dairy products like milk, cheese, or yogurt. It's commonly used as a supplement because it's easy to digest and contains all nine essential amino acids your body needs to build muscle.

## #2 The Ingredients Found In Plant-Based Powders Are More Nutritious Than Animal-Based Powders

Plant powder supplements are more than just a meal replacement or an ideal supplement for people with dietary restrictions. Here are some of its ingredients and how it can benefit you:

- Glutamic Acid (mg) - They improve athletic performance
- Glycine (mg) - Prevent muscle breakdown
- Serine (mg) - Improves cognitive function

They also have a low glycemic index, making them a more favorable choice for people with diabetes. Most powders like [Premium Plant Vegan Protein](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/premium-plant-vegan-protein) are specifically formulated to have less cholesterol and less fat. This allows the product to have more lean protein compared to animal-based powders.

One of the biggest reasons why many people choose plant-based protein powders over animal-based ones is because they contain fewer allergens and are more nutritious.

Plant-based protein powders are made from various types of plants, such as hemp seeds, peas, or rice. They don’t contain any dairy products or soybeans like animal sources do. This means they can be a great option for those who have food allergies or intolerances.

In addition to being free from common allergens, plant-based protein powders are also higher in fiber than many animal-based proteins — making them a better choice for weight loss!

## #3 Plant-Based Protein Powder Is Easier To Digest Than Animal-Based Protein Powder

Protein is an important part of our diet, but not everyone who opts to take whey protein can digest it easily. Plant-based protein powders are easier to digest than their animal-based counterparts. This is because they are made up of proteins that are broken down easily by the digestive system, while animal protein sources, like whey, remain largely intact.

This makes them the perfect option for people who want to reduce their meat intake. They are also great for people who want to increase their fiber intake.

Plant-based protein powders are much easier to digest than animal-based protein powders. This is because plant-based protein powders contain more fiber and less fat, which makes them easier for your body to break down and digest. Animal-based protein powders are digested quickly, so they can cause stomach aches and bloating if you're not used to consuming them.

An additional benefit is that plant-based protein powders are often much more affordable than animal-based options.
