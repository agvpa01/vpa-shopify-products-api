It is also one of the few plant-based proteins containing the entire range of amino acids humans need for optimal health.

Quinoa comes from a small, hearty plant grown by the Incas for 5,000 years until Europeans rediscovered it in the 16th century. Quinoa is native to South America and cultivated in Bolivia since 3000 BC and Peru since 1500 BC.

Quinoa has a delicate, slightly nutty flavour and an unusual fluffy texture because of its tiny seeds or grains (which are more like beads). Quinoa is quick-cooking and can be used as an alternative to rice or couscous.
