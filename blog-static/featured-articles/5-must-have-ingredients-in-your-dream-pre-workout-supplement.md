## Pre-workout Supplements

Pre-workout supplements are a great way to increase your energy and performance during training. They contain a mix of different ingredients that will result in increased strength, increased endurance, and more.

Most people aren't aware of the ingredients that go into these supplements and what exactly they are for. However, if you are in your fitness journey for the long term, it’s time to get acquainted with the key ingredients in your pre-workout supplement. Knowing more about the right ingredients that make up your pre-workout helps you make a better informed decision when choosing the best pre-workout for you. Here are five of the most crucial ingredients that you need to look out for:

### Caffeine

Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant. Caffeine can improve reaction time and your attention span.

The amount of caffeine needed for the benefits to occur is 100mg. This is about 1-2 cups of coffee, or 2-4 cups of tea. If you're going to take a pre-workout supplement containing caffeine, be sure it contains [100mg per serving](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2854104/).

Caffeine is also effective with athletic performance which is why it is one of the primary ingredients in pre-workouts. It is an effective ergogenic aid, which means it improves physical performance. It can also improve cognitive function, endurance, and mood.

### Creatine Monohydrate

Creatine Monohydrate is a supplement that enhances the body's ability to regenerate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and exhibits strong anti-fatigue effects. [Studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14636102/) show that taking creatine can increase your strength by as much as 8%. Creatine Monohydrate is something you want to make sure you have in your pre-workout supplement if you are looking to get those gains from strength training.

### Beta Alanine

Beta Alanine is a supplement that has been used in bodybuilding for years. It’s main purpose is to buffer lactic acid and limit muscle injury. The lactic acid build up during intense exercise can cause you to stop working out – and that’s where beta alanine comes in handy.

This supplement is also good at fighting fatigue and increasing the amount of time it takes for muscles to reach fatigue (i.e., it delays the onset and prolongs the duration of muscular fatigue). As a general rule, those who have [lower amounts of this amino acid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6376352/) will experience more muscular fatigue than those who have higher levels within their bodies.

### Citrulline Malate

Citrulline Malate is a chemical compound that produces energy for the body. It is found in the mitochondria of cells and it performs two important functions. Firstly, Citrulline Malate helps to transport ammonia from the blood to the liver for conversion into urea. Secondly, it acts as an [ATP regenerator](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12145119/) in muscle cells.

Citrulline Malate is able to build up levels of ATP more quickly than any other amino acid, including arginine. This means that Citrulline Malate can generate more energy for your body with less fatigue or soreness during exercise. Many people have been using it in their pre workout supplements because of these benefits. But if you are looking for a high-quality supplement, always make sure the ingredients are safe and effective.

### Taurine

Taurine is an amino acid that can be found in vegetables, seafood, dairy products, and meat. It's one of the most abundant amino acids in the human body. Taurine helps to maintain healthy liver function and regulates hormones.

People who are looking for a pre-workout supplement may want to consider including Taurine in their supplement regimen because it has been shown to [increase performance](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19423840/). This amino acid is crucial to enhance mental clarity, improve muscle recovery, and reduce fatigue during workouts. Taurine also helps with exercise performance by increasing energy production and reducing pain after workout.

It can be found naturally in protein-rich foods like red meat, eggs, dairy products, and fish. But your pre-workout supplement should contain it as well!
