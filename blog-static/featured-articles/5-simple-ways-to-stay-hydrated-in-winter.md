## Stay Hydrated in winter with these 5 easy steps

### 1. Establish a daily drinking goal

This is an easy one to do. Research indicates we need to drink 2L of water a day. There are many apps available to track your water intake. A simple way to track your water intake is to carry a water bottle with you. We have a [black insulated water bottle](https://www.vpa.com.au) if you are looking for a new one. It keeps your drinks icy cold and feels great in your hand due to the rubber feel coating.

Set a target number of glasses or cups of water throughout each day — for example, five glasses at meals during the day and two glasses before bedtime. Set an alarm on your phone to remind you to drink throughout the day instead of waiting until you're thirsty before sipping some water from the tap (which can be too late).

### 2. Replace the water that you lose

During physical activity we lose water through sweat. Before you undertake any exercise ensure you are adequately hydrated. During the workout drink consume some fluids. There is no magic number of how much to drink as it depends on the duration, intensity, weather, and type of clothes worn. As a general rule the goal is to [prevent fluid loss](https://journals.lww.com/acsm-healthfitness/fulltext/2013/07000/exercise_and_fluid_replacement__brought_to_you_by.3.aspx) of greater than 2% body weight. Post workout the goal is to replace lost water and electrolytes. If you are looking for a hydrating post workout drink [Protein Water](/products/protein-water) is a fantastic option.

Staying hydrated is important year-round, but especially during the winter months when we're losing more water through sweat and breathing. So it's important to replenish your body with plenty of fluids — water, coffee, tea, or even hot chocolate (as long as you steer clear of the sugary syrups).
