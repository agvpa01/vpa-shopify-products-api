## 2. Write a blog for us – we will pay $25 per blog article approved by our team

Ever wanted to write a blog about something but haven’t started on it yet? Now would be the perfect time! Wanna share a workout challenge? How about a nutritious recipe for us to try out?

You could write about how you are feeling and what you are doing to keep yourself busy while you are quarantined. You could also share your experience with other people who have been quarantined. This will help them know what to expect and how they can make the best of their situation as well.

Keep track of all the things that you do during your quarantine period so that when you get out, you can share them with others who might be interested in reading about them. This may include things such as exercise routines, recipes that use foods that are available during quarantine, or even just daily journal entries about what it's like being isolated from everyone else in the world for several months at a time!

Any health and fitness topics are welcome, but we don’t mind topics outside this area as well so long as it’s helpful and relevant information.

Submit your entries to [sales@vpa.com.au](mailto:sales@vpa.com.au)

## 5. Make some high protein snacks

Making some high protein snacks will help you in two ways; first it will help you kill some time, and second, you will have some healthy and high protein snacks to munch on each day. You can find our protein recipes [here](/blogs/recipes).

A recent team favourite was the choc caramel protein pancakes which you can find [here](/blogs/recipes/choc-caramel-protein-pancakes). These are great for a lazy work from home breakfast!
