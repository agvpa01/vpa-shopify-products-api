## Beet 500

### What is Beet 500?

BEET 500 is a pure and natural beetroot powder and nitrate supplement. It is made from freeze-dried concentrated beetroot juice. Beetroots, beetroot juice, and beetroot powder are natural sources of nitrate, and nitrate is a sports performance enhancing compound. The evidence that beetroot improves sports performance is so strong that the Australian Institute of sport have classed it as a Group A supplement, meaning that it works!

### What does beetroot powder do?

Beetroot powder is a natural but potent source of nitrate. When consumed, our bodies convert nitrate into nitric oxide. Nitric oxide has many important roles within the body, but its benefit to sports performance comes from its ability to dilate and expand our blood vessels, allowing more blood to be delivered to our muscles. This increased blood flow carries more oxygen to our muscles, allowing you to work harder. Nitrate also reduces the energy cost of exercise and helps muscle contraction.

## Sports gels

---

When we exercise our body uses two sources of fuel to feed our muscles – fat and carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are used as the main fuel source – and are relied on more for high-intensity exercise. We store carbohydrates as glycogen in the muscles. As we exercise, muscle glycogen levels begin to fall. If these stores are not replenished performance can be affected. Sports gels can also contain other ingredients like electrolytes such as sodium to replace minerals lost through sweat. Some also contain caffeine.

### Performance Gels

VPA® Performance Gels use two types of carbohydrates. They contain fast-acting fructose to give you a quick acting energy boost. They also contain maltodextrin which is a slower acting energy source. Using two types of carbohydrates means that your muscles will get a steady stream of energy.

### Magnegel

Magnesium is critical for nerve and muscle function and is essential for maintaining bone health. A magnesium deficiency may result in muscle spasms, nerve twitches, cramping, and fatigue. VPA® magnegel contains added magnesium to promote energy and recovery. Magnegel assists with maintaining adequate mineral concentrations during exercise to promote optimal performance. After exercise, Magnegel provides nutrients that positively affect energy production and recovery.

## Creatine

Creatine increases the rate at which energy can be produced and used within our body. Creatine helps you work harder and work longer by helping to replenish our energy systems. This increases peak power output, and this, in turn, has several positive impacts.
