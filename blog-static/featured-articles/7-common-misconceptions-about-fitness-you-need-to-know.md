### Treadmill Running Is Just As Beneficial As Running Outside

The idea that running on a treadmill is as good as running outside is a misconception. Running on a treadmill does not provide the same benefits as running outside. There are many reasons for this, including a lack of sufficient oxygen intake, resistance, and uneven ground.

The benefits of running on a treadmill are only short-term and do not provide long-term health benefits like running outside does. The most significant difference between the two forms of exercise is that when you run on the treadmill, you are not getting sunlight exposure which has many health benefits, such as getting your vitamin D.

### There Is No Gain Without Pain

People often believe that they need to be sore after a workout or that they haven't really worked out if they are not in pain. This is false. The muscles need time to recover from the training, so they will feel less sore over a few days. A lack of soreness doesn't mean you didn't work hard enough for your workout. Don't let this misconception discourage you from hitting the gym.

Once you start working out, it's all about the gains. You will be stronger, more flexible, and less overweight. You'll feel better about yourself and have more energy. Many individuals believe that in order to make any success with fitness, they must put in a lot of effort. But that is not true! Small changes can lead to big results!

### The Only Purpose for Lifting Weights is for Bulking Up

A misconception leads many people to believe that the only way to build muscle is by lifting heavyweights. This is not true. One may opt to lift lighter weights to build muscle as long as the weights are enough for one to feel a good amount of tension and fatigue. Once your body is accustomed to the current weight, you continue to add more.

Many people do not understand the importance of using lighter weights to build muscle and increase their fitness levels when doing strength training exercises. They have been led to believe that simply lifting heavy weights is the only way to get stronger and bulk up. You should know that lighter weights can be used for strength training exercises too.

### You Should Warm Up By Stretching Before Working Out

The misconception is that stretching before an intense workout will allow you to go further and work harder. It's been found that stretching can actually lead to greater injury, so it is better to only stretch after a workout.

[Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1250267/) has shown that pre-workout static stretching can do more harm than good for people who want to get in shape because it lengthens muscles' natural resting length, which could lead them into the danger zone, where they are susceptible to tearing or other problems. It is not necessary to stretch before a workout if you will not be doing anything that requires flexibility.

The above statements are true but keep in mind that this only applies to Static Stretches. There are two different types of stretches that you can do: [Static and Dynamic stretches.](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/types-of-stretches-before-a-workout) The dynamic can one be used prior to workout as it does not cause muscle tear.

### Crunches Are The Only Way To Gain Abs

The misconception that crunches are the only way to gain abs is commonly seen on social media. The truth is that ab exercises can be done in different ways. Crunches are just one of them, and it's essential to do them the right way for them to have any effect on your body.

Some ab exercises can be done with household items like a broomstick or while lying down on the couch. Other than crunches, other examples of exercise include planks, sit-ups, and side bends. These exercises target different parts of your abs, so you need not solely rely on crunches if you want a well-toned stomach. It is highly effective to do a full-body workout instead.

A full-body workout is an exhaustive one that involves multiple muscle groups. It can help you break through plateaus by forcing your muscles to work in different ways. It targets your abs, back, chest, shoulders, arms, hips, and legs so you will get toned all over. You can do this at home or in a gym with the help of fitness videos on YouTube or DVDs. Full-body workouts are more effective because they force your muscles to work out in different ways. This helps break through plateaus and shed fat faster than just doing crunches alone.

### There Is A Specific Time Of Day That You Should Work Out

There are many misconceptions about when you should exercise to get the most out of your workout. Experts say that there is no good time to exercise. Everything boils down to what feels right for you. The optimal time of day for a workout is different for everyone. The timing is determined by your body's circadian rhythm, which can vary by person. The key takeaway is that it doesn't matter what time of day it is - if you want to be in the best shape possible, then you have to make sure that you're exercising regularly and not giving up on yourself because you think it's too late in the day or too early in the morning.

### Exercising on an empty stomach yields better results.

The idea that you must exercise on an empty stomach (or fast for a while) is a misconception. It is not necessary to have an empty stomach to produce better results from your workout. Exercising on an empty stomach will result in increased fat burning, but you will also feel tired and weak. It is more important to have good, healthy carbohydrates before your workout to get the energy needed and maintain focus during your exercises. It's best to eat after exercising instead of before - this gives your body time to digest the food and will keep you more energized during your post-workout session.
