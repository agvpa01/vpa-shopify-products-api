### Setting and Achieving Goals

Setting and achieving your goals can be made easier if you follow the advice in the following steps.

- Think about the things you'd like to change in your life. Be specific about the changes you'd like to see. What will you be doing differently in six to twelve months if you are happier than you are now?
- Make a list of all the things you want to accomplish. Attempt to be as descriptive as you can. Goal-oriented people are more likely to achieve than those with ambiguous aims.
- Keep track of your goals in positive terms. Replace "to wake up at 8.00 am" with "to wake up at 8.00 am every day".
- Keep your goals attainable and realistic. It's more probable that you'll fail and be disappointed if you create goals that aren't realistic. Consider your financial situation, time availability, emotional resources, and other aspects of your life to make sure you're being realistic when you set your goals.
- Organize your long-term and short-term goals into separate lists. Give yourself plenty of leeway in terms of the time it will take to achieve your goals. Many short-term goals must be met before a long-term goal can be achieved. Think of these as the ladder rungs that lead up the final step towards your goal of reaching the top. If possible, assign a deadline for the accomplishment of each objective.
- Each aim should be broken down into steps. If your aim is to land a new job, think about the measures you'll need to take to get there. If you're having trouble finding work, it's possible that you'll need to revise your CV, chat with a career counsellor, peruse the local paper, and so on. In the same way as before, set a deadline for each stage.
- Recognize your accomplishments by rewarding yourself when you reach each stage or the ultimate goal. Acknowledging your accomplishments is essential. Each step you take is a sign that you are getting closer to your goals.
