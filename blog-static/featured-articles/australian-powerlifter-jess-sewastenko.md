### Becoming an Elite Athlete and Powerlifting Journey

Becoming an elite athlete and competing not just nationally, but also worldwide is the "dream" of everyone who competes competitively, and sometimes because of various factors, it might feel intangible. If you're looking for an inspiration to start lifting or becoming a successful competitive athlete, our interview blog with one of Australia's strongest, Jess Sewastenko, might be the spark you need.

VPA® Athlete, Jess Sewastenko, a world powerlifting record holder shares everything we need to know in her journey as an elite powerlifter - how and when her passion for powerlifting started, her advice on how to become a successful athlete, how she conquered being anxious and how powerlifting improved her way of living, and her recommended supplements that assist her and keep her moving like a champion that she is.

### 1. Fitness Journey and Diving into Powerlifting

You’ve come so far and now recognized and respected as an elite powerlifter - can we go back and rewind to how your fitness journey started? What was your life like before diving into powerlifting sports?

Looking back, I would have never expected to find myself so obsessed and in love with feeling strong. Prior to powerlifting, I have always found myself competing in sport – I was part of the Australian Karate Federation (AKF) team for many years and competed nationally and internationally for 10 years prior to finding powerlifting. My powerlifting journey began in 2015 when I was back at university doing an exercise science degree. We began learning about coaching and had some practical lifting classes and I was hooked once I began these! Once I began picking up weights, it started to become addictive, and I became obsessed with lifting more and more.

### 2. Gravitating Towards Powerlifting

Out of all the variety of sports and competitions to join, why did you gravitate towards powerlifting?

When I began training, I never invested in a coach early on, so I found the transition into powerlifting (squat, bench, and deadlift) much easier to self-coach myself with. I knew a friend who was a member of Powerlifting Australia and he encouraged me to give it a go. I began a 12-week online strength program and signed up for my first comp in 2017, and I never looked back!

### 3. First Competition Experience

What was your first competition like? What’s your biggest challenge then as an athlete competing as a beginner?

My first competition was in 2017 in Canberra. I put competing off for a few months originally because I felt I wasn’t strong enough. In hindsight, I wish I had just jumped in earlier (and realistically we never feel strong enough to be ready). Being my first comp, I kept myself calm and reminded myself that I needed to just have fun and enjoy the experience. The best decision was entering a competition where I didn’t know many people, therefore I could lift somewhere different, meet new people and just enjoy the experience without the pressure of too many familiar faces around watching me (I’m secretly quite an anxious lifter lol).

### 4. Recent Personal Bests and Competition Wins

Can you share with us your more recent personal bests?

How did it feel when you landed your first win/title? What do you consider your best practices or the key to your wins?

My best competition experience was last year at the Fitness Expo in Sydney in April. I lifted as a 57kg lifter which meant I made a 7kg weight cut in the lead up and was feeling very strong. I had a plan set a couple of weeks out, and we stuck with it on the day and executed one lift at a time. I ended up squatting 147kg, benching 91kg, and deadlifting 194kg – which gave me an Australian deadlift and total record, I won the 57kg women's weight division and was the best lifter of the competition. That is by far my most memorable comp because I felt everything had come together (weight, lifts and I had so much fun). Trusting the process throughout and sticking to our game plan were huge successes on the day.

### 5. Lessons Learned and Applied to Daily Life

From the struggles and wins you’ve faced and conquered, what’s the most significant lesson you’ve learned from it that you apply to your daily life?

I have gained so much resilience from powerlifting. Not just with lifting, but I find myself so determined to stick with things which challenge me and I refuse to give up. I have also found that powerlifting has indirectly helped me develop such a healthy lifestyle – I have my same training time and routine which allows me to get going for the rest of my day. Prior to lifting, I was quite an anxious person too with not too much confidence, and lifting has allowed me to open up and be confident in general day to day.
