### While there are plenty of benefits from taking creatine, the most popular question people seem to wonder about is whether or not it actually works. The benefits of creatine are undoubtedly real, but they're not made up out of thin air; they exist because past [research](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-017-0173-z) has found that taking creatine is beneficial when it comes to achieving optimum fitness results.

Let's explore 10 of them and learn more about this amazing product.

#### #1 increased muscle mass and size

Creatine powder is popular among bodybuilders and athletes because it contains amino acids. Creatine helps increase the muscles by controlling the muscle breakdown. It increases the amount of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) in skeletal muscle cells.

It also promotes the increase of hydration and nutrient transport in muscles. All this action combined with exercise or resistance training promotes an increased muscle mass and size.

#### #2 reduced fatigue

Fatigue is associated with having low ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) levels. It follows that creatine supplementation reduces fatigue by increasing the level of ATP in the brain. It even proved to not only help physical fatigue but [mental fatigue](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11985880) as well.

---

#### #3 improved muscle function

Creatine supplementation helps increase your phosphocreatine stores. This is its primary mechanism of action that brings energy and improves muscle function during any exercise performance.

---

#### #4 enhanced fat-burning potential with increased metabolism

Creatine enhances fat-burning potential by increasing metabolism and decreasing appetite. By increasing the rate of ATP production in your muscles, creatine increases the speed of your workouts and power output during exercise!

It also improves oxygen uptake, which means that you'll get more out of every single calorie burned - literally! Your body will get all the fuel it needs for maximum performance while preserving lean muscle mass at the same time!

---

#### #5 increased mental performance with increased focus and concentration

One of the effects of creatine is it improves mental performance like focus and concentration while training at high levels of intensity like during an intense game of soccer or even during regular resistance training. Again, this is also due to the increased presence of ATP.

#### #6 Improved strength

Another effect of creatine supplementation is improved strength. This is due to the sudden burst of speed and energy during training. Creatine is also stored mostly in your muscle, and when in high amounts, it would increase its production to help your muscles gain more strength during training.

---

#### #7 Higher energy levels

Creatine gives you higher energy levels. It does this by helping the body convert stored fuel in muscle cells into Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the main source of cellular energy in the human body. This process occurs when you lift weights or when your muscles are engaged in any type of high-intensity exercise.

---

#### #8 helps in the recovery process after strenuous exercise

Creatine supplementation can be helpful during the recovery time after workouts. Creatine helps in maintaining ATP/ADP ratio, and ATP is responsible for energy production in cells. It also replenishes depleted phosphocreatine levels which are necessary for cell function and muscle contraction.

---

#### #9 prevents neurological diseases

It effectively treats neurological diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's by increasing the levels of neurotransmitters like dopamine, glutamate, and serotonin. Dopamine, glutamate, and serotonin are neurochemicals, which are crucial in neuronal communication.

These are neurotransmitters that play an important role in the brain's ability to adapt to environmental changes. If there is an imbalance in these neurochemicals, that's when neurological diseases can occur.

#### #10 Helps control blood sugar and prevents diabetes

Studies have shown that it can help lower blood sugar levels in people with diabetes by increasing the number of insulin receptors on cells. It [assists in glycemic control](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20881878) in people with diabetes mellitus type 2. This leads to reduced blood sugar levels in people with diabetes.

There are different forms of Creatine, and its most popular one is powder. With the numerous benefits, creatine supplements are one of the best supplements you can use to assist you on your fitness journey.
