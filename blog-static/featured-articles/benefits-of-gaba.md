## GABA Benefits

You have heard of GABA, but are you aware of its benefits? Do you know how much it influences your health and mental state? Read through and discover the top five benefits of Gamma- Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) to the body and brain. First, you need to understand what GABA is.

GABA is an abundant inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. GABAergic synapses are responsible for regulating neuronal excitability and maintaining homeostasis.

Neurotransmitters are chemicals that can carry signals from one neuron to another neuron or other types of cells. They work by binding to receptors which are docking points for these chemicals on the surface of neurons.

Here is a rundown of the benefits of taking GABA supplements:

## GABA Helps with Anxiety-related Disorders

GABA is responsible for slowing down neurons' activity and reducing their excitability. In other words, it helps calm down our brains.

When GABA levels are too low, people may experience several different symptoms such as anxiety, irritability, insomnia and even seizures. One way to promote a healthy level of GABA is through a diet that includes a variety of foods containing the amino acid L-Tryptophan, which converts into 5HTP, which converts into serotonin, which then converts into GABA.

Simply put, eat more [foods containing gamma and high levels of L-Tryptophan](https://www.myfooddata.com/articles/high-tryptophan-foods.php) like milk, lean turkey and chicken, beef, oatmeal and more.

## GABA helps stabilise mood

A stable mood is essential for mental health and overall wellbeing. It helps to make better decisions, and it makes you more productive. People who feel less happy or content with their life are more likely to experience mental health problems like depression, anxiety, and addiction.

GABA is responsible for [regulating neuronal excitability](https://www.nature.com/articles/4001021#:~:text=Mood%2Dstabilizing%20anticonvulsant%20medications%20raise,regulation%20in%20multiple%20cortical%20regions.). This function is crucial for mood maintenance and balance. For those who suffer from anxiety or stress, it can be helpful to take GABA. Many GABA-rich foods are some of the best mood stabilisers because they promote a sense of calm and relaxation while not causing lethargy.

## GABA helps manage Blood Pressure

Low blood pressure is essential for a healthy lifestyle because it helps to prevent cardiovascular disease. There are a lot of effects of GABA, and one of those is to help [lower blood pressure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4613098/#:~:text=Central%20GABA%20can%20decrease%20blood,to%20maintain%20normal%20blood%20pressure.) levels.

The study showed that GABA inhibits the release of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate and aspartate. This helps relax the muscles and calm the mind, resulting in lowered blood pressure levels.

## GABA Benefits Mental Clarity and Performance

The neurotransmitter GABA is an inhibitory one that balances the brain's excitatory system. It helps promote mental clarity and boosts performance in some cases. A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep12770) in 2015 showed that people who took 800 mg of GABA daily were able to prioritise their tasks more.

## GABA Improves Sleep Quality And Protects The Nervous System From Damage Due To Aging And Diseases

GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. If there is an excess of this neurotransmitter, then it can cause anxiety, and because of that, people with anxiety tend to have trouble sleeping.

GABA helps to create a calming atmosphere in the brain, so it can [improve sleep quality](https://www.objectivewellness.com/journal/posts/meet-gaba-your-new-best-friend-for-falling-asleep#:~:text=By%20inhibiting%20neural%20activity%2C%20GABA,associated%20concerns%2C%20like%20difficulty%20sleeping.) for those who struggle with anxiety. It not only helps you sleep, but it also protects your brain. The levels of GABA in the brain are linked to the number of neurotransmitters the brain is releasing. One of its functions is protecting neurons from damage due to aging and diseases.
