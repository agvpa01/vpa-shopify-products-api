# Yoga Benefits

Yoga is more than just a physical exercise. It is a spiritual practice that can help you better understand yourself, your body, and your environment. Yoga requires patience, dedication, and consistency to reap the full benefits of its practice.

Practicing yoga may help you thrive at home and at work especially keeping you grounded when stress is at an all-time high. While there are many other ways to bring positive change to your life, in this article we talk about ten ways yoga can help you succeed through daily practice.

## 1. Yoga helps relieve pain

Yoga is a popular method of reducing pain. It also proved to reduce pain in people with certain conditions like migraines, fibromyalgia and pain in the lower back. Yoga reduces pain by increasing blood flow, reducing inflammation, improving communication between the central nervous system and the rest of the body and stimulating endorphins in the process.

Yoga can be a good alternative for people who cannot use traditional pain relief methods like NSAIDs (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) or opioids as they might increase your risk of developing pancreatitis, stomach ulcers, or kidney disease.

According to a [paper published by the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr085.pdf), 55% of people who practice yoga have reported that their sleep quality has improved.
