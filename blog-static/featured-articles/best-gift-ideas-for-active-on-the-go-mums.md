If you're looking for gift ideas for a mum who loves to stay active, look no further. Here are some thoughtful and practical gift ideas that are sure to please.

### 1. Fuel for her days ahead

Gift her some of VPA® delicious high protein goodies that you can vouch for yourself!

For a delicious breakfast in bed treat, we recommend whipping up nutritious stacks of buttermilk pancakes with our easy [Protein Pancake Mix](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/protein-pancake-mix/) and top them off with her favorite fruits in season! Or perhaps whip up a delicious protein shake with our newest protein flavors – Choc Peanut Butter Cup and Fruity Cereal because who doesn’t love these two familiar flavors?

We also recommend our other protein blends:

- [Lean Shake Plus](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/lean-shake-plus-meal-replacement?_pos=1&_sid=63223c0e5&_ss=r) – formulated with all the necessary nutrients to kickstart and fuel her body for the day, this meal replacement protein powder is the healthiest version of a full spectrum meal in a cup!

### 2. Fitness Tracker

Fitness trackers are excellent gifts for mums on the go who enjoy tracking their steps, heart rate, and daily activities. These gadgets allow mums to monitor their progress, set goals, and motivate themselves to stay active. There are plenty of options on the market, from budget-friendly options to high-end devices.
