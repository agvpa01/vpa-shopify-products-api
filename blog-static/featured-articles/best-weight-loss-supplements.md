If your goal is to lose weight, lose fat, shred, or achieve a more toned body then you have probably googled- "Best supplements for losing weight.” The world of weight loss supplements can be overwhelming, so we are here to help find the best one for you.

To lose weight, one must have a calorie deficit. But is a high protein intake necessary? “Is protein one of the secrets to weight loss?”, was a question that an Accredited Practising Dietitian and Accredited Sports Dietitian, Aidan Muir, answered and discussed in a blog a while back. The research is clear that protein is the most satiating of all the macronutrients. If you eat 1500 calories per day and have 30% of your calories coming from protein you will likely feel fuller and reduce your appetite. A high protein intake also boosts metabolism and changes several weight-regulating hormones.

### 1. WPI or WPC

Our protein powders are one of our best-selling products for reasons being, they are guaranteed of highest quality, pure Australian NZ whey protein. Supplementing with a good quality protein powder is a great way to do it. It isn’t necessarily better than reaching the same protein target through food, but there are times when it is far more convenient since it requires zero prep time and you can also easily take it on the go.

### What is Whey Protein Isolate?

Whey Protein Isolate or WPI is a very fast-digesting dairy protein that consists of at least 90% protein, with almost no carbohydrates or fats. WPI is also 99% lactose-free, making it suitable for most people who are lactose intolerant.

### What is Whey Protein Concentrate?

Whey Protein Concentrate or WPC is a slower-digesting protein that contains lots of macronutrients and bioactive compounds. WPC is a great option to consume throughout the day.

[What’s the difference between WPI and WPC?](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/supplements/wpi-vs-wpc-what-s-the-difference) We’ve that covered on a different blog to help you choose which one is right for you.
