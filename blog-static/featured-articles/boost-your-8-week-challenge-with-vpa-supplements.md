## As you start your 8 Week Challenge

As you start your 8 Week Challenge, youâ€™ll want to ensure that you have the necessary tools before beginning this program. Aside from the meal guides provided within the program, supplementation can help you reach your fitness goals, particularly if your diet doesn't provide you with all the necessary nutrients.

We have a few suggestions that can aid you in achieving your fitness objectives. Whey protein isolate, however, is our number one recommendation. The supplements listed below have a solid track record of helping users reach their fitness objectives when used consistently.

### WPI/ Whey Protein Isolate

[Whey protein isolate](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder) is one of the two main whey proteins available today. Whey protein isolate comes from skim milk and has been purified through an ion-exchange process to remove almost all non-protein components such as lactose, minerals, fats, and carbohydrates. The other type of whey product is concentrate, which is made from whole milk by removing most of the fat content (usually about 80%).

The result is an extremely pure form of whey protein (generally more than 90%) that contains all the essential amino acids your body needs without any carbohydrates or fats getting absorbed.

### How does it work?

Whey protein isolate is considered a high-quality form of whey because it has been filtered to remove most of the lactose and fat molecules, leaving behind a pure form of whey protein.

Because it contains very little carbohydrate, it's less likely to be stored as fat than other types of protein. It also takes time for your body to digest, so you feel full for longer after eating foods containing whey protein isolate than you do after eating foods containing other types of protein.

This can make it easier for you to lose weight by helping you eat fewer calories without feeling hungry.

#### Benefits:

- Helps build muscle mass and strength
- Promotes better digestion and absorption of nutrients
- Increases energy levels by boosting metabolism and providing fuel for muscles
- Lowers cholesterol levels because it contains no saturated fat or cholesterol
- Decreases appetite by making you feel full longer

### WPC/ Whey Protein Concentrate

[WPC](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/premium-whey-wpc) is a combination of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. It contains a large percentage of protein, essential fats, vitamins, minerals, and electrolytes. This combination makes it an excellent source of nutrients that support muscle growth and recovery after intense exercise.

#### How does it work?

Whey protein concentrate contains a large amount of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) that are essential for muscle growth and repair. The body breaks down BCAAs to form glucose and uses them as fuel during exercise. This process helps delay fatigue during exercise and makes you more resilient to injury. Whey also contains glutamine, which helps promote muscle growth by improving recovery time between workouts.
