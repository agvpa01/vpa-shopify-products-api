## BACKGROUND

Caity G’s gym journey stems back to 2019 when she decided to transform her lifestyle and sign up for the gym. Caity’s reasoning for joining the gym stemmed from a place of insecurity and simply not feeling confident in the way she looked, especially after moving from her small rural country town, Winton, to the big smoke, Brisbane, for university where she had endless options of food delicacy to choose from. Caitlin’s relationship with food and body image took a turn for the worse.

As we are sure so many of you can relate, Caity for months was terrified of the weights section in the gym and for months she spent tireless hours doing only ab-circuits followed by running for kilometers around her neighborhood to try and burn the weight off.

After a good 6 months of being in a back and forth relationship with the ab-circuits and cardio machines, she finally built up the courage to step into the weights room. Then COVID hit…

As you know, during this time gyms shutdown for the foreseeable future. Caity was determined to not let it slow her progress. She took full advantage of the only being allowed to go outside for essential activities which of course, included exercise. She went for a 10-kilometer run nearly every single day of COVID lockdown.

Unfortunately, during this time Caity did develop another unhealthy relationship with food. As you may be aware, during this time the infamous 1200-calorie diet began to trend on platforms such as TikTok. Admittedly, being uneducated in both nutrition and the basic nutrients that the body needs to function, this led to more complications with Caity’s eating habits including binging. Caity would under fuel her body during the week which led to binging episodes on the weekend. This felt like a never-ending repeating cycle.

Fast forward to post COVID, Caity had decided she wouldn’t let her fear of the weights room hinder her progress in the gym any longer. She didn’t have much knowledge about the gym and which exercises would be the most beneficial to her goal, which was to lose weight and put on muscle at the same time (in hindsight, she knows just how silly this goal is). Caity, did however have a TikTok and Instagram account and that's where she would find her inspiration for her workouts. To her own surprise, she put on quite a bit of muscle.

Fast forward again to February 2022, the grand opening of World Gym Stafford. Caity signed up to this flash new hub for Bodybuilders and decided to invest in a coach. Unfortunately, at the time budget only allowed for a training program and not the nutrition side of things (again, thank god for the internet).

If you know Caity, with the level of intensity, determination, and intention she puts into every single one of her sessions, that was all she needed to see her strength skyrocket. Caity G is actually known for training negative 3RIR.
