# How to Gain Muscle Efficiently

One of the biggest questions in the fitness space is how to gain muscle as quickly and efficiently as possible. Accredited Practising Dietitian, Aidan Muir, discusses best practises on approaching calorie surplus for muscle gain.

## Variables Involved

The first thing I want to point out is that there is not going to be a stock standard answer. I am going to assume that everybody reading this article is doing some form of resistance training. If the goal is muscle gain, then that is obviously going to be important.

If you enter a calorie surplus without any training stimulus, you will likely still gain some muscle, but [the ratio of fat to muscle is going to be terrible](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2336074/).

 

## Textbook Recommendations and the Issue With Them

Personally, my first proper introduction into concepts related calories and macros came from spending time on the bodybuilding.com forums. On that forum, people would talk about how a 500 calorie surplus would result in roughly a 1/2kg per week weight gain. And a 1000kcal per day surplus would be double that at almost 1kg per week.

This is backed up by similar recommendations in nutrition textbooks that base it on the composition of muscle mass and how much energy is required to create that muscle mass.

Muscle is roughly 75% water, 20% protein and 5% fat, glycogen and other minerals and metabolites. So these calculations are often based off a combination of the calories required to build that amount of muscle, using the amount of calories required for the protein, fat and glycogen.

I like the simplicity of this idea, but unfortunately, it is more complex than this.

 

### Reasons why it can be almost impossible to come up with a clean number include:

1. As calorie intake increases, the number of calories burned through the thermic effect of food increases. The thermic effect of food is typically [8-15% of total daily energy expenditure.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12499328/)
2. As calorie intake increase, calories burned through non-exercise activity thermogenesis typically increases. And this impact varies drastically different in different individuals
3. As calorie intake increases and energy availability improves, the basal metabolic rate might adjust slightly. This impact is more pronounced if coming from a low energy availability state where the body had to down-regulate some processes that burn calories.
4. When you are on restricted calories, the body can become slightly more “efficient” during exercise and burn slightly fewer calories. Obviously, in a surplus, energy expenditure can change related to that.

There are a whole bunch more factors. But this dramatically increases complexity. For example, if you give somebody a 500kcal surplus, is it ACTUALLY a 500kcal surplus if their energy expenditure increases by 250kcal due to having more calories coming in? One person’s expenditure might increase by a small amount, while another person’s might increase by a larger amount.

The way I look at it, although we have heaps of ways we can theoretically think about this, all that we really care about is what happens in practice. We only really care about what ratio is muscle vs fat at different calorie surplus sizes.

 

## So What Is The Ideal Size?

Even though this is an area that a lot of people are curious about there is a surprisingly [small amount of research on the topic](https://journals.lww.com/nsca-scj/Abstract/publishahead/Magnitude_and_Composition_of_the_Energy_Surplus.99278.aspx).

- **For people who are new to training** and have everything in their favour, 1-2kg per month is probably going to be ideal.
- **For females** I would likely go at the more conservative end of that spectrum.
- **As people progress**, I would look at slowing it down towards that <0.5kg per month mark at the other end of the extreme, for somebody really close to their potential.

Going higher than these rates is okay if you are willing to embrace some more fat gain. From an anecdotal perspective, it is interesting to note that from I can tell, a large percentage of people who have done a major transformation with their physique over the years have done something called a “dreamer bulk” at some stage.
