This Wednesday 8th March 2023, marks 112 years since the first International Women’s Day. So, we thought, why not celebrate the women who help to make VPA® Australia an amazing place to work and provide you, our customers, with high quality tasty supps.

We are a diverse group of women, from different backgrounds, interests, sporting ability and education but together we make a formidable team. Let’s meet some of these women:

## Kathleen

This Advertising Major Graduate is the one who pops emails into your inbox every week updating you on all the VPA® news. Her creative flair is shown through her passion to write and create content. Her drive for learning new things about health and fitness is evident in the content she creates.

**Favourite VPA® Products:** Protein Water in Sour Worms, Protein Bars, GABA

**Health/Fitness Goal:** I've fallen in love with strength training because of VPA®. I started out with the social media manager role and absolutely loved the passion and drive everyone had in the fitness community. And when your daily programming is as lively and supportive as the VPA® Fam, you dive right in. This year, however, I'm switching up my routine and training for a focus on endurance. I'm learning all the ways to optimize and listen to my body for a good long run. I plan to run my first 1/2 marathon this year. Let's go get it!!

## Caitlin

Our Events Coordinator barely needs any introduction. This fun-loving character is the face of our VPA® TikTok's and IG Stories. Caitlin has the ability to have a chat and make everyone feel at ease, it’s a trait everyone here admires. Her love for the gym has been instrumental in some of the new VPA® accessories you will be seeing during 2023 *wink wink*.

**Favourite VPA® Products:** WPI (Vanilla and Salted Caramel), Creatine and Venom® Pre-Workout (Sour Watermelon)

**Health/Fitness Goal:** I am very much a gym rat as they say. I have been working out since I was 18 years old. Initially, I started my fitness journey because I was insecure of how my body looked. My original goal was weight loss, which I actually didn't achieve so to say. Throughout my training journey, I fell in love with the process of building muscle and seeing just how strong I could become. I have completely changed my body composition - increasing my muscle mass and decreasing my fat mass significantly. I am now training to take my physique to the next level and naturally compete in the Wellness division at ICN in Season B, 2023.

## Joanne

Joanne is one of our friendly Customer Service Team. Chances are if you’ve contacted us via phone, email or chat Joanne is the helpful person on the other end of the line. Her quick and accurate responses ensure our customers receive exceptional Customer Service.

**Favourite VPA® Products:** Summer FomoTM, L-carnitine, WPI Rainbow Ice Cream and Collagen Pro®

**Health/Fitness Goal:** I have worked in the Health and Fitness Industry for a number of years but VPA® has changed the way I view health and fitness. I have been inspired on my weight loss journey because of the 8 Week Challenges VPA® has run and seeing the results our customers have achieved following the workouts and meal plans. As a result, I have started to build up my own home gym with various equipment including dumbbells, barbells and kettlebells.

## Gladys

One of the critical behind the scenes women is Gladys who heads up our Finance Department. Not only does she pay the bills (we all need someone who can do that!). Her tenacity and ability to network ensures we can secure the highest quality ingredients at the best possible prices to make the tastiest supps money can buy.
