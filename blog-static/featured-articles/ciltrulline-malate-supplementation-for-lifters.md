### What is citrulline malate?

Citrulline malate is a supplement used to increase strength and endurance. The main benefit of citrulline malate is an increase in nitric oxide levels, which can improve blood flow to muscles. How does it benefit powerlifters?

Citrulline malate contains L-citrulline bonded with malic acid.

L-Citrulline is an amino acid which gets converted by the body into [L-arginine](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/aakg?_pos=3&_sid=fd7d5935f&_ss=r). Arginine is converted into nitric oxide. Nitric oxide promotes the relaxation and opening of blood vessels which increases blood and oxygen flow through the body.

Citrulline malate enhances creatine phosphate regeneration – meaning quicker recovery between sets. Research doesn’t appear to support that this happens for L-citrulline alone, so this aspect is attributed to the malic acid.

The reason why citrulline malate is used instead of arginine supplementation is that it actually raises blood arginine levels more effectively than arginine supplementation since arginine is more poorly absorbed. Taking high enough dosages of arginine to reach appropriate levels is possible, but often leads to GI distress.

### Benefits of citrulline malate?

Citrulline Malate [increases blood levels of ornithine and arginine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17953788?dopt=Abstract) and improves nitric oxide metabolism and the ammonia recycling process.

This increases [lactate](https://www.medigraphic.com/cgi-bin/new/resumenI.cgi?IDARTICULO=36827) and [ammonia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28664349) clearance following exercise. For lifters, this appears to have a carryover effect for people doing multiple sets of an exercise. While the first set might only have a mild improvement, if any at all, the later sets might show a much more noticeable improvement.

This ammonia-buffering effect reduces acidosis during exercise and also helps [reduce delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMs) noticeably](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7440292?dopt=Abstract).

Citrulline Malate also [improves ATP production following exercise](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12145119?dopt=Abstract), which is another aspect as to why it might help more as sets progress. Malic acid is an intermediate in the citric acid cycle, which is how it is theorised to help with this process.

The main implications of supplementation appear to be the ability to [add an extra couple of reps](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26658899) here and there while resistance training. There potentially could be benefits for supplementing citrulline malate for endurance performance, but there isn’t a lot of research to support that view at this stage.

---

It’s also unclear whether adding [citrulline malate into other supplements provides an additive effect](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23281794?dopt=Abstract). [Caffeine](https://idealnutrition.com.au/the-low-down-on-caffeine-and-sports-performance/), [creatine](https://idealnutrition.com.au/creatine/), and [beta-alanine](https://idealnutrition.com.au/?s=beta+alanine) supplementation each individually could provide benefits for lifters.

### Does citrulline malate work?

It has been interesting watching the research evolve over the years. Up until 2016, the research was mostly promising for citrulline malate. Since then there have been some studies showing mixed results.
