### Roman Poet, Aulus Persius Flaccus, famously once said “he conquers who endures.”
In other words, perseverance will lead to victory. He wasn’t alone in understanding the importance that this nine-letter word represented. Gautama Buddha, popularly known as Buddha, explained that “endurance is one of the most difficult disciplines, but it is to the one who endures that the final victory comes.” Although these quotes were famously recorded in such wide gaps in history (483 B.C and 34 AD to be specific), the take-away message is constant; endurance equals victory. It’s because of this, that it should not come as too much of a shock, that nowadays endurance training is a popular form of training.
