We've all been there. You decide to overhaul your life overnight, pledging to eat nothing but kale and hit the gym every day. You're going strong for a week or two, but then life happens, and you find yourself face-first in a pizza box, feeling like a failure. 

It's time to ditch the "all or nothing" approach to health and fitness and embrace a more balanced and sustainable lifestyle. In this article, we'll explore some easy-to-follow tips on building healthy habits to make sure we’re counting more wins than losses this year.

## 1. Start Small, Really Small

The first rule for building healthy habits is to start small. Like, minuscule small. Instead of aiming for a complete diet overhaul, try incorporating a single healthy habit into your daily routine. This could be as simple as swapping out your morning doughnut for a piece of fruit or taking a 10-minute walk during your lunch break. Small changes are easier to stick with and can lead to big results over time.

### Bad habits

Bad habits are formed out of routines that give us immediate pleasure. Think, doom scrolling on social media – easy and low commitment as opposed to actual learning or working on things that actually matter to you.

The [National Institutes of Health](https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2012/01/breaking-bad-habits#:~:text=Habits%20can%20also%20develop%20when,of%20computers%20and%20social%20media) say that these bad habits activate the brain’s reward system. They make us feel good by releasing dopamine, a chemical in the brain. This can create a loop where we keep doing the same thing to get more dopamine.

But bad habits can have negative effects on our physical or mental health over time. They can also lower our productivity.

## 2. Consistency Trumps Intensity

Gone are the days of pushing yourself to the brink of exhaustion during workouts or surviving on salads alone. Consistency is the name of the game. Opt for regular and manageable changes to your routine to make sure you can realistically keep them up. Whether it's a daily walk, a weekly dance class, or yoga sessions, find what works for you and stick to it. It's the steady effort that wins the race.

## 3. Make Things Enjoyable

Whatever the goal, it helps to find ways to make it exciting rather than a dreaded chore. For example, if you’re building on the habit of consistently exercising, find an activity you genuinely enjoy, and you'll be more likely to stick with it. Love dancing? Take up dance classes. Enjoy the great outdoors? Try hiking or biking. When exercise becomes a fun part of your life, it's no longer a burden.

Here are some other ideas up on our sleeve:

- **Cleaning the house** – blast some music while you’re at it and bop to your favorite tunes!
- **Staying hydrated** – keep your cool and trusty [VPA 1L Insulated water bottle](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/1l-insulated-drink-bottle) beside you at work to remind you to keep hydrated throughout the day.
- **Fight doom scrolling** – find productivity apps that lock certain apps (Eep!) for a period of time. Set it your way, of course. This is certainly very useful at work. Your boss will love it for you. *wink
