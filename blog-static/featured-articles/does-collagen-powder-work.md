## Is There a Difference Between the Various Types of Collagen Supplements?

To better understand what collagen does, you have to know the different types and uses. There are three sorts of collagen supplements:

### 1) Hydrolysed Collagen:

It is used for joint and bone pain relief. It has been shown in studies to reduce the risk of arthritis by 15-30%. They also [promote weight loss](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7539343/) as they suppress the hunger hormone ghrelin. An article from [Further Food](https://www.furtherfood.com/collagen-for-weight-loss/) enumerated other ways that collagen can cause weight loss.

### 2) Injectable Collagen:

It is given through an injection to help with conditions such as osteoarthritis, bone fracture repair, and rheumatoid arthritis.

### 3) Non-Injectable Collagen:

This type of collagen is taken orally and can help with reducing joint pain and inflammation.

If you are simply looking for one that helps you with weight loss or skin health, a hydrolysed collagen would be your best bet.

## How Can People Consume Collagen Supplements?

Collagen powder can be taken as a supplement or as a food additive. People who do not have a good enough diet or those who work out excessively should be taking collagen supplements daily. It will help them reach their goals of muscle growth and recovery.

Collagen supplements are generally consumed in the form of pills or powders that need to be mixed with water or milk to make them easy to drink for people who don't like taking pills every day. There are also [Collagen supplements](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/collagen-pro) that are almost flavourless, which is great with coffee!

## Does the Amount of Time That a Person Consumes Have an Impact on the Benefits Gained From Consumption?

Yes, it does. The amount of time that you consume collagen protein powder matters. If you consume it for a short period, like two or three weeks, then it might not give you enough benefits to warrant the effort.

Taking collagen supplements plus your body's collagen production would warrant great benefits. You will experience more of its benefits the more you take them.
