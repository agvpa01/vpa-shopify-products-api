One of these [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5068479/) says that exercise is the best way to boost your self-esteem. The scientists found that people who exercise tend to have higher feelings of self-worth and believe they are more attractive than those who don't.

People have many [misconceptions](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/7-common-misconceptions-about-fitness-you-need-to-know) about exercise - some think it's hard or tedious or too expensive, but it can be very easy if you know how to do it right.

## Here are five ways exercise can boost your self-esteem:

- The physical benefits of exercise

- [Exercising](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/five-tips-on-starting-your-fitness-journey) is an essential part of living a healthy lifestyle. It improves our moods, helps with weight loss, and reduces the risk of disease or chronic pain.

It's not hard to understand why working out is good for you. The most common is how it helps you [lose weight](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/does-sweating-help-you-lose-weight). But there are some physical benefits that people might not know about.

## Mental health benefits

Exercise is one of the most common treatments for mental health. It promotes a sense of calm and relief from anxiety and depression, and it can even help prevent them.

[Researchers](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/exercise-and-mental-health) have found that people who exercise regularly are less likely to develop mental health conditions like anxiety, depression, and dementia later in life.

The mental health benefits of exercise are well-documented. It is a proven fact that exercise has a positive effect on brain function and mood.

## Staying motivated

It's only natural that people who exercise are motivated. Exercise is one of the most effective ways to give you an immediate boost in the morning. Here's why.

Exercise releases endorphins, dopamine, and serotonin. These hormones increase alertness and motivation, which means people get more done during the day when they get up for their workout than when they get up after.

Exercise has also been shown to reduce stress levels, improve moods, reinforce memory, and improve sleep quality.

## Building confidence

People who exercise are more confident in their day-to-day life. They can handle pressures better, and stress levels decrease. They also tend to focus on the good things in life, which boosts confidence.

People who exercise have a higher level of confidence and make more intelligent decisions. People who exercise regularly tend to have higher self-esteem and a better outlook on life. On the other hand, people who don't exercise lack focus and drive, which can affect their work performance.

Many want to exercise but don't actually do it. Some would start but never stick to their routine. There are many things that can help you stick to your exercise routine. You could schedule time into your schedule or schedule exercise into your day. If you have a partner, you could work out together or take turns planning the day's workouts. Whatever strategy works for you, make sure you set up a game plan before starting and don't give up once it gets hard.

If, after weeks of exercising consistently, the exercise feels like a chore instead of something enjoyable, try adding some variety or switching up what you're doing (e.g., running outside one day and doing power walking another). Whatever you decide to know, know that there are nothing but benefits to exercising. You may not lose weight immediately if that is your goal, but you will definitely see a change in your self-esteem.
