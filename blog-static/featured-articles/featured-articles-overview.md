4. **Stay Consistent**: Consistency is key when it comes to fitness. Make a schedule and stick to it, even on days when you don't feel like working out.

5. **Listen to Your Body**: Pay attention to how your body feels during and after exercise. Rest when you need to, and don't ignore any signs of pain or discomfort.

Remember, starting a fitness journey is a personal and rewarding experience. Stay committed, stay positive, and enjoy the process!
