Alright, you're reading this blog post today, and you want to know how to get fit in 2022. That's enough intro for me! I know what you want. Here's how to get leaner and stronger by the end of 2022.

## Be specific in defining your goals in 2022

Once you have an idea of your goals, it's time to sketch out a plan. Make sure to include details that give you measurable milestones. For instance, you may want to lose 15 pounds by 2022. That's a solid goal and one that can be timed to your schedule.

Setting realistic fitness goals is the first step in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. If your plans are too lofty, there's a good chance you'll become frustrated and give up on them entirely. If they're too modest, you might not feel like you're achieving enough, which could lead to burnout.

## Create a breakdown of your action plan

Breakdown your goal into smaller pieces. If you want to run a marathon next year, for example, you don't need to start training for that 26-mile event today. Instead, set smaller goals like running a mile every other day or walking three miles on Saturday afternoons. By setting goals you can accomplish each day, week, or month, you'll stay motivated and on track toward reaching bigger milestones.

Start today. One of the biggest reasons people give up on their fitness plans is because they think they can't start until January or February – which is completely ridiculous. After all, January 1st doesn't care about your goals any more than any other day of the year does! Start today.

Here are four things to keep in mind when setting personal fitness goals for 2022:

### 1. Your main goal should be to enjoy yourself.

If you're pushing yourself so hard that you're miserable, you won't keep at it.

A lot of the time, people get frustrated when they don't see changes right away. But it can take weeks or months for positive changes to become apparent in your body. Patience is key!

### 2. It's OK to have more than one goal.

If you're more interested in strength training than aerobics, set a goal to lift weights every other day and do cardio on off days. Your goals don't have to be precisely the same as your friends'. Just make sure whatever you choose is safe and doable for you.

### 3. Don't worry about what other people are doing.

You don't have to go to extremes just because someone else is doing them. Exercise at a level that's comfortable and fun for you — not at a level that's designed to impress everyone else around you!

### 4. Staying motivated.

It doesn't require spending tons of money or driving yourself crazy with extreme diets — just staying active! Look for opportunities to walk or bike instead of drive, join an intramural team or play a fitness club.

## Keep track of your progress

Just like you can't lose weight if you don't track it, you can't make changes to your health if you don't track it.

This is because tracking your progress keeps you honest and accountable. If you're not tracking, you're more likely to make excuses as to why you skipped a workout or why you ate that piece of cake.

Tracking also helps hold yourself accountable. You may be tempted to skip a workout when your spouse isn't around, but if they know about it, they are more likely to keep you in check.

The last benefit of tracking is that it helps give you awareness of your behaviors to make minor improvements each day.

For example, let's say one of your goals was to drink more water per day. You may find that by tracking this behavior, you realize that the majority of days have only had two glasses of water or less than what's recommended for an adult male. This gives you the awareness that even though two glasses are better than none, there's room for improvement and seeing where you now give you a starting point for making positive change. You may even find out from tracking that some days have no water at all!

There's no one-size-fits-all way to reach your goals, but taking a multi-pronged approach that includes smart planning and genuine commitment is a surefire way to get you to reach all of them. There's no failure in that—that's the real goal. Do everything you can so that you don't have any regrets and so you can feel good about yourself when you look back at your accomplishments in 2022.
