# Five Tips on Starting Your Fitness Journey

1. **Set Clear Goals**: Define what you want to achieve with your fitness journey. Whether it's weight loss, muscle gain, or overall health improvement, having clear goals will keep you motivated.

2. **Start Slow**: Don't push yourself too hard at the beginning. Gradually increase the intensity of your workouts to avoid burnout and injuries.

3. **Find an Activity You Enjoy**: Whether it's running, swimming, dancing, or weightlifting, choose a physical activity that you find enjoyable. This will make it easier to stick to your fitness routine.

4. **Stay Consistent**: Consistency is key when it comes to fitness. Make a schedule and stick to it, even on days when you don't feel like working out.

5. **Listen to Your Body**: Pay attention to how your body feels during and after exercise. Rest when you need to, and don't ignore any signs of pain or discomfort.

Remember, starting a fitness journey is a personal and rewarding experience. Stay committed, stay positive, and enjoy the process!

### 1. Put yourself in the right environment

Being in the right environment is critical for your fitness. Simply put, if you don’t enjoy training, you aren’t going to want to continue, right? Being in a space that you feel comfortable in, surrounded by positive and uplifting people, will be hugely influential on you. Your mood will be through the roof every time you walk into the gym, and you will be motivated to push yourself. Sometimes that feeling of ‘we’re in this together' with your mates is what helps you push through, so make sure your fitness crew is rock solid!

### 2. Track your progress

You are training to get results, no doubt about it. A great way to ensure you are staying on target is to track your progress. This can be recording the weights you lift each week or recording how fast you complete a certain workout. Over time you will be able to look back on your very first week and see how much you have improved. Trust me; it happens faster than you think!

### 3. Experiment

Don’t be afraid to experiment with different training styles and sports. You must enjoy what you are doing and enjoy the process of training. A big misconception about getting fitter is that you must sign up for a gym membership and lift weights. Don’t get me wrong, I could ramble on for hours about the significant benefits of resistance training, but if going for a bike ride three times per week is more your flavour, who am I to stop you?

### 4. Get a personalised program

Too many gyms and trainers out there will try and get you onto a pre-set ‘cookie cutter’ program that is not individualised to you. Work with a trainer that you TRUST and get a program created that is specific to your needs and goals. Your movement mechanics, goals and circumstances are unique, so having a program that matches this is ideal.

### 5. Something is better than nothing. Stay consistent

Absolutely above all else, staying consistent is key. Pick a training schedule that works for you, and don’t push the limits too early! The worst-case scenario here is that training gets thrown into the ‘too hard basket’, and you fall off the wagon completely. Always remember that doing something is better than nothing (even if it’s just taking your dog for a walk)! The more sessions you do, the better you’ll get!

So, I hope that you’ve found these tips helpful and that it fast tracks your fitness journey.
