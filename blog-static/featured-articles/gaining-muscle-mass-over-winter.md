### The meat and nuts breakfast.

Yep, you heard right. Meat and nuts for breakfast.

*"The meat allows for a slow and steady rise in blood sugar. The nuts provide a great source of healthy smart fats that allows the blood sugar to remain stable for an extended period of time." (Charles R. Poliquin)*

As we know breakfast is the most important meal of the day. We are often too busy to eat a sit-down breakfast so some initial prep at the start of the week preparing the meat can save precious time.

Take the benefits of this new breakfast all throughout your day – Multiple studies on employee productivity have demonstrated that a high protein breakfast does not only impact on the energy and productivity levels of morning till noon, but extended its positive way in the late afternoon.

## On those days where you cannot have the meat and nut breakfast try this awesome on-the-go power smoothie

Ingredients:
- 250mL milk or Almond milk
- 1 banana
- 1 scoop VPA® Protein
- 1 tsp peanut butter
- 2 whole eggs
- Cinnamon ground

Place all the ingredients into a blender and drink straight away. Blending eggs

*Note: The purpose for eating the raw eggs is for the dietary fats in the egg yolk. One small study compared the absorption of protein from both cooked and raw eggs in 5 people. The study found that 90% of protein in cooked eggs was absorbed, but only 50% in raw eggs. In other words, protein in cooked eggs was 80% more digestible.*
