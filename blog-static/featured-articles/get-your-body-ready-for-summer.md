## TEN EASY TIPS TO GET THAT BEACH-READY BODY NOW!

We are slowly approaching the days of sun, sand, and, most importantly, summer bodies.  
This means that summer is just around the corner. The sun is shining, the waves are crashing, and you can smell BBQs in the air.

### GET ENOUGH SLEEP
There are many reasons why you might need to get enough sleep to get a summer body. Sleep deprivation can lead to being more prone to diseases, being more stressed, and not being as productive.  
Try these tips for getting enough sleep:
- Create a [bedtime routine](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/sleep-hygiene) to give your body an idea that it is sleeping time
- Avoid screens near your bedtime.
- Keep your bedroom cool and dark, so it's easy for you to fall asleep.

### Eat more vegetables and fruit
Fruits and vegetables are nutritional powerhouses. They are important for your dietary needs. Just eating more of these can make a huge difference in your health.  
You should not be worried about the calorie count. Vegetables are also low in calories but rich in fibre and nutrients that will help you to feel fuller for longer.  
If you want to get that summer body, then eating more vegetables and fruit is the way to go!

### Reduce your sugar intake
We often think that eating sugar is a harmless indulgence. However, this is not entirely true. A cupcake can be harmless, but like anything, sweets need to be taken into moderation. Overloading sugar can cause a range of health issues, from tooth decay to obesity and diabetes.

### Stop eating close to your bedtime
The late-night is a time of day when people are more likely to be either snacking or going to bed with a full stomach. All this indulging in unhealthy foods will cause weight gain and lower your metabolism rate.  
What is considered late-night eating? Study shows that eating [less than two to three hours before bedtime](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/8-secrets-to-a-good-nights-sleep) is considered late-night eating and should be avoided. That's why it's essential for people looking to lose weight and get a summer body to stop eating two hours before going to bed.

### Exercise
It's essential to incorporate exercise into your routine to achieve a beach-ready body. Regular physical activity not only helps in weight management but also improves overall health and well-being.
