## For the Mum Who Loves to Work Out Indoors: ZOGIN Mini Exercise Desk Bike

Mums who are trying to get fit have it tough. Not only do they have to find time in their schedules to work out, but they also have to make arrangements for someone to watch their kids when they do so. That's why a ZOGIN Mini Exercise Desk Bike is perfect for a mum who works out indoors. It lets her get the exercise she needs while still being available to listen to her children tell their stories and help with homework.

The first thing you notice about this bike is that it's small and compact. While most stationary bikes take up a lot of room, you can tuck this one into any corner of your house and even roll it into another room if you want to change locations. If you're short on space, or simply want a bike that's easy to store, this may be the right fit for your mother!

## For the Mum Who is Constantly on Her Feet: Harmony Tea

There's nothing like a good pick-me-up for every tired mum, especially for the mum who is always on her feet. A day in the life of a mum means constantly being "on" and ready to be there for their kids. When you're trying to fit in work and errands on top of that, it can be easy to forget to prioritize self-care. But when mothers don't take care of themselves, it's not only you who suffers; your family will be affected too.

VPA® Harmony Tea is a wonderful way to reinvigorate oneself each day and restore equilibrium in life. As a busy mom, your mother needs to be healthy and alert in order to function at her best—and this tea can help. It promotes a balanced immune system and keeps your energy levels up without caffeine or any other stimulant, so whether you're taking it in the morning before the chaos of the day begins or as an afternoon pick-me-up after lunch, it'll give her the boost she needs to keep going strong.

## For The Mum Who Does Yoga: Tibetan Singing Bowl Set

When it comes to Mother's Day gifts, we tend to get caught in the obvious trap: "I know she loves flowers and chocolate, so those must be the best gifts!" But while it's a time-honored tradition to give your mum a bouquet or take her out for dessert, there are plenty of other ways you could celebrate her.

If your mum is into yoga, then you've probably gotten her more than one mat over the years. (There's only so much use one can get from a mat before it needs replacing.) What we suggest is something unique for your mum - a Tibetan singing bowl.

A Tibetan singing bowl set is a great gift for the mother who enjoys yoga because it is something that she can use to enhance her practice. Singing bowls have been used for centuries in various religious practices, particularly Buddhism. They are said to calm the mind and relax the body. A set of singing bowls can be used in meditation or in yoga practice to focus the senses. It's definitely a unique gift that will show your mum that you care about her well-being and are interested in what she does!

## For The Mum With A Sweet Tooth Who Needs An Energy Boost: VPA® Protein Bars

A protein bar is a great gift for the busy mum who needs an energy boost. And, if she has a sweet tooth, VPA® Australia’s Protein Bars are the perfect gift because they contain 18g of protein and are infused with real chocolate. These gourmet chocolate-flavoured bars are a great way to treat your mum, while at the same time getting all the fitness benefits associated with high-quality protein powders and snacks.
