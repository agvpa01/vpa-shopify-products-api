## Content

Energy drinks are among the most popular beverage around with millions of adults drinking them in order to stay focused and increase their energy. However, many people do not realize that all energy drinks are not created equal when it comes to their content and ingredient. Let us explore the different ingredients in your favourite energy drink and understand how helpful it is for your fitness journey.

## BCAAs
Let's take a look at what BCAAs are, how they work, and how you can benefit from them.

BCAAs are a group of three essential amino acids—leucine, isoleucine, and valine—that make up one-third of your muscle protein. Your muscles use them during exercise to prevent fatigue and support recovery. Unfortunately, while you can get some BCAAs through your diet, they're only found in protein-rich foods such as beef, chicken, eggs, fish, and soy.

BCAAs are particularly useful for muscle building because they reduce protein breakdown by [increasing protein synthesis in your body](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/branched-chain-amino-acids). In addition, BCAA supplements have been shown to reduce exercise fatigue and help with post-exercise muscle soreness. Many athletes and fitness enthusiasts turn to branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) to help them get the most out of their workouts. BCAA supplements are usually taken before and after exercise, but did you know that you can get 1000mg of BCAAs in an energy drink? VPA® WRKOUT energy drink has exactly that many BCAAs in 1 bottle!

## Caffeine
Caffeine is a bitter substance found in coffee, tea, soda, and energy drinks. It acts as a stimulant to the central nervous system, helping you stay alert and giving you that extra boost of energy. [Caffeine is also a diuretic](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19774754/), which causes water loss in the body by increasing urine output. Athletes need to hydrate well before, during, and after exercise to maintain adequate fluid balance. Aside from the energy that caffeine provides, here are two more of its benefits:

### 1. Caffeine improves physical performance
Caffeine can improve your physical performance by increasing adrenaline production in the blood. Adrenaline, also known as epinephrine, is a hormone that prepares your body for intense physical exertion. During exercise, muscles use up their glycogen stores for energy. Caffeine helps preserve glycogen stores so that you can work out for longer without tiring out and put maximal effort into your exercise.

### 2. Caffeine can raise your metabolism
Caffeine can raise your metabolism and even make you more alert. The increased metabolism leads to an increase in fat burning. [Evidence](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/news/20210323/caffeine-before-exercise-fat-burn-study#:~:text=Overall%2C%20the%20research%20team%20found,for%20equal%20hours%20of%20fasting.) suggests that consuming caffeine 30 minutes before exercising may help burn more fat during exercise.

## L-tyrosine
L-tyrosine is an amino acid that helps make protein and other important compounds in your body. It's a "nonessential" amino acid, which means your body can make it on its own, but there are some benefits to having more of it in your system than what your body can produce on its own. It is found in foods such as milk, meat, fish, and wheat, but it's also added to some nutritional supplements and energy drinks. L-tyrosine is also used to enhance memory and alertness, increase energy, and fight against the negative effects of stress.

## B3, B5, B6 and B12
B3, B5, B6, and B12 in your energy drink will boost your energy levels. These vitamins exist naturally in the body and naturally occur in food sources like vegetables. In addition, they are water-soluble, which means that if you take too much, your body will eliminate any excess through urine. While this helps ensure the safety of vitamin intake, it also means that you need to replenish these vitamins to benefit from them constantly.

- B3 is critical for maintaining healthy skin, nerves and digestive systems. It helps release energy from food by breaking down carbohydrates and fats into glucose.
- B5 helps the body convert fat and carbohydrates into energy. It is also essential for making hormones, including sex hormones (testosterone), stress hormones (cortisol) and neurotransmitters (serotonin).
- B6 is essential for many bodily functions, including processing proteins and producing red blood cells. It also helps maintain healthy brain function by promoting serotonin production.
- B12 plays a key role in making DNA and red blood cells in the body. It also helps release energy from food by breaking down carbohydrates and fats into glucose.

## No fat, carbs or sugar
Energy drinks are a popular way to give yourself a boost of energy, caffeine, nutrients and essential vitamins. The best energy drinks are those that have been designed to provide the right balance of all these things in just the right amounts for your body's needs. People who regularly consume energy drinks may be doing more harm than good if they get the wrong kind of drink. Some energy drinks are full of sugar, fat, and carbs, eventually leading to weight gain, diabetes, and other health problems. The best energy drinks don't contain any fat, carbs or sugar, like VPA® WRKOUT Energy Drink. These kinds of drinks can help you feel energized without weighing you down or making you feel sluggish later on. Many different brands of energy drinks are available on the market today with varying degrees of effectiveness and safety.
