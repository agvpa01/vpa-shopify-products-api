### Boost your immune system

Now a year after the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, we find a stronger and shared global awareness for the importance of our overall health and hygiene protocols to avoid getting sick. Building a healthy lifestyle is vital for us to maintain our health and wellbeing during these challenging times.

Here’s a quick checklist to ensure you’re all set on the path to a healthier lifestyle.

Our immune system works to defend the body against invading toxins and bacteria so strengthening it is key. A great way to do so is by trading off unhealthy habits for a healthier lifestyle by consuming fresh and nutritious food, engaging in regular exercise, and getting good sleep. In the midst of the pandemic stress and anxiety, we know how hard it can be to keep this up but we’re here to give you a few tips to make it easy.

You may already have these immune boosters lying around the kitchen, if not, remember to grab some at your local grocery store and incorporate them into your homemade meals.

- Citrus fruits – high in Vitamin C
- Capsicums
- Broccoli – is supercharged with vitamins and minerals. It is packed with vitamins A, C, and E, as well as fiber and many other antioxidants.
- Garlic
- Ginger – helps decrease inflammation.
- Spinach – packed with numerous antioxidants and also rich in Vitamin C.
- Yogurt – good source of vitamin D and probiotic cultures that strengthen the digestive track.

Sometimes when we fail to get the right nutrients from our food, a great way to boost your immune system is by taking supplements.
