### The time has finally arrived! It’s the time to launch the VPA® 8 Week Challenge. This is your time to shine, to put those New Years Resolutions finally into action.
Here are five quick nutrition tips to help get you along on your journey.

#### 1. There’s no such thing as super-foods, eat a balanced diet

You don’t need to be eating expensive Goji berries in order to be healthy or to smash out your goals for the VPA® 8 Week Challenge. There really is no such thing as a super food; all foods have their nutrient qualities. Goji berries might contain high levels of healthy antioxidants such as zeaxanthin but so do a range of green leafy vegetables (spinach, kale, broccoli). Don’t spend a fortune buying into the latest trends; just eat a balanced diet full of variety. Variety in our diet is crucial not just to reap the benefits of consuming a diverse range of critical vitamins and minerals, but also to avoid consuming too much (or too little) of any given nutrient.

#### 2. Make sure you are staying hydrated

Did you know dehydration affects 80 percent of Australians, yet the majority of people are unaware of the signs and symptoms. Drinking adequate water each day is important for a variety of reasons, including body temperature regulation, joint lubrication, infection prevention, nutrition delivery to cells, and organ performance. Sleep quality, cognition, and mood all benefit from being well-hydrated which is what you will be needing during the VPA® 8 Week Challenge. An easy way to make sure you are getting enough H20 in is to drink two glasses of water before leaving the house in the morning and another when you get to work or your destination. Also make sure that no matter where you go make sure you fill a reusable bottle with water; this will encourage you to drink more, save you money on bottled water, and protect the environment.

#### 3. Be organised so you can still be social!

Don’t let the VPA® 8 Week Challenge stop you from remaining social and going out for lunch or dinner with family and friends. You can still enjoy socialising without compromising your challenge goals. You just need to make sure you are organised. By calling the restaurant or café ahead of time, you can discuss your dietary requirements and determine what food is suitable for you.

#### 4. Monitor the oils that are you consuming

Oils contain a lot of calories and are a good source of energy. Including oils in your diet is an excellent method to get vital fats in and aid in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins including A, D, E, and K. The kind of fat ingested is equally as significant as the overall quantity of fat taken in terms of health. Each tablespoon of olive, coconut, canola, and vegetable oils has roughly the same number of calories. One tablespoon of coconut oil has 117 calories, olive oil has 119 calories and canola oil has 120 calories. Make sure that you are factoring in oil when monitoring your intakes.

#### 5. Don’t cut out entire food groups

Even if your goal for the VPA® 8 Week Challenge is to lose body fat, don’t jump on the band wagon of cutting out entire food groups such as carbohydrates. Yes, you may lose weight initially by removing them from your diet. But in order to prevent “challenge burn-out” you need to make sure you still eat the foods that you enjoy but in a moderation that suits your calorie intake.
