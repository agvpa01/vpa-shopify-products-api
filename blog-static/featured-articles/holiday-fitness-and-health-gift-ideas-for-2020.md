## What a year it has been! 2020 has undeniably been a challenge for everyone and is a year which completely highlighted the importance of our health and wellbeing. It has brought to light many ways for us to manage stress and stay active.

With the holiday season just around the corner, VPA has rounded up some of the best fitness and health gift ideas to support your loved ones’ goals or legendary comeback.

### 1. A Gym Membership

There is nothing more awesome than gifting your loved one with a gym membership. Gyms and fitness studios are brimming with great energy and a lively community full of support and growth. It is the perfect stepping-stone for anyone who wants to kickstart their fitness journey and is a real treat for anyone who is already on their way to killing their fitness goals.

VPA’s growing roster of stockists, gyms, and even personal trainers have grown exponentially this year despite the current situation which tells us that safety protocols have been followed and it should be safe to get back to the gym.
