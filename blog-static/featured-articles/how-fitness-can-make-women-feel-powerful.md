## Fitness Makes Women Feel More Attractive

Several women have made fitness a part of their lives, from gyms to fitness classes and even simple daily walks. Women who exercise feel more attractive and confident about their bodies. A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5068479/) showed that fitness boosts self-esteem, which helps make one feel more attractive.

## Fitness Empowers Women to Stop Comparing Themselves to Others

As women, we are constantly bombarded with messages about what's considered beautiful, sexy, and strong. We see magazine covers of airbrushed models and celebrities in movies with perfect abs. It's easy to be sucked into the vortex of comparison, which breeds shame and self-loathing.

When you go to the gym, there are always people in better shape than you as well as people in worse shape. But what's important is that everyone is working on themselves. Everyone is focused on their achievements and progress, you should focus on your own achievement and progress too.

The world of fitness is not a one-size-fits-all kind of place. It's important to remember that there are many paths that lead to the same end goal, which is health and happiness. You don't have to be a professional athlete or bodybuilder to achieve this goal; you just have to find what works for you.

## Fitness Makes You Realize How Strong You Are

As women, we are constantly bombarded with images of what beauty is supposed to look like. But there's another side to that coin. What about strength? What about power?

Many women think of fitness as a way to lose weight, and while this may be true for some, I see the practice of exercise as a way to build strength and power â€” physically, mentally, and spiritually.

I believe in the power of fitness because I've seen how it has transformed myself and my clients. When you work out, you discover what your body can do and how strong you are.

In a society that puts an emphasis on looking good (not necessarily feeling good), fitness provides something more: confidence. It makes you feel good inside and out. It empowers you to feel strong.

## Fitness Improves Mood and Reduces Stress

Exercise has been proven to reduce the body's stress hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol. It also stimulates the production of endorphins, which are brain chemicals that act as natural painkillers and mood elevators in the body.

Keeping active is a great way to feel better, gain health benefits, and have fun. Being active is good for your mental health and wellbeing.

For women, fitness should not be a chore, but rather it should be a rewarding and liberating addition to their lifestyle. Though you get uncomfortable at first, you know that [your reward and progress would be worth it](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/progression-amidst-discomfort).

For many women who have started a fitness routine today, this lifestyle change has resulted in increased confidence, a better appreciation for their bodies, and decreased stress levels. For these reasons and more, incorporating fitness into your routine can be empowering in ways that you may not expect it to be.
