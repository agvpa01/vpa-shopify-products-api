### Some Clothes Can Increase Performance

The proper workout clothes can increase performance. It's not a myth! The proper clothing is essential to maximizing your workout, whether you're running in the park or lifting weights at the gym.

There are three main types of clothing for different types of physical activity. These types include:

- Performance-oriented garments
- Water-repellent garments
- Waterproof garments

When you're working out, comfort is vital. You want to enjoy yourself without having to worry about being in pain or feeling restricted by your clothing. This is especially true if you plan on working out for more than an hour at a time. Longer workouts usually require more flexible clothing that doesn't restrict movement while allowing sweat to evaporate quickly, so you don't overheat while exercising.

The right clothes are not only comfortable, but they can also make it easier for you to perform better during your workout session. Some types of clothing are designed specifically with athletes in mind because they help them perform better during training and competition events.
