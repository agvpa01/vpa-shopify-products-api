## Blood Flow Restriction Training

*Blood flow restriction training* is a technique that was developed by Dr Yoshiaki Sato in Japan 1966 as a means of maintaining muscle during immobilization. Resistance training for bone mineral density and the maintenance of muscle mass underpins musculoskeletal health. Whether you are a young athlete trying to maintain muscle mass or older individual trying to maintain functional capacity in a home-based setting, BFR or Blood Flow Restriction Training can be a useful strategy. Some studies have shown that strength training at 20-30% 1 RM have been shown to elicit comparable improvements in muscle mass to training at 70% 1 RM. Obviously, using heavy loads above 70% 1 RM in your living room is going to present some challenges so BFR is a potential avenue which could provide some food for thought.

One can go for smart adjustable weights that take up minimal space within the home. Make sure these weights provide a fantastic option to allow for progressive overload in a home-based setting without requiring the space of a typical rack of weights.
