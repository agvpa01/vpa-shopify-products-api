Sometimes, it's the simplest things that have the most profound impact on our health and well-being. Diaphragmatic breathing, also known as belly or abdominal breathing, is one such practice that engages your diaphragm, an important large muscle located between your chest and abdomen, to breathe deeply and efficiently.

It also offers numerous benefits including enhanced lung function, cardiovascular health, and stress management.

### But what exactly is belly breathing, and how does it differ from regular shallow breathing?

Shallow breathing primarily involves the chest and upper body, leaving the diaphragm – your most efficient breathing muscle – largely unengaged.

- **Diaphragmatic breathing**, on the other hand, harnesses the power of the diaphragm, leading to deeper and more efficient breaths. The physiological processes involved in belly breathing are fascinating to explore.

When you engage in this practice, you actively engage your diaphragm and abdominal muscles. This facilitates a fuller expansion of the lungs, optimizing oxygen intake, and allowing for a more efficient release of carbon dioxide.
