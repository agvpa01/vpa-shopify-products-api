## Acacia Fibre

Acacia Fibre is a soluble fibre, which means it absorbs water and becomes gelatinous. This process fills up the stomach, making you feel fuller for longer periods. The combination of increased feelings of satiety, low-energy digestibility, and improved insulin sensitivity leads to better body composition.

Remember that this only works if you combine Acacia Fibre with a healthy diet and exercise routine. You won't achieve results by simply eating more than usual in one sitting. If anything, you'll probably gain weight because your body will store the excess calories as fat.

Unlike most other fibres, Acacia Fibre doesn't taste bitter or cause digestive discomfort because it doesn't ferment within the large intestine as other fibres do. Instead, it passes through the intestines intact because its molecular structure is too large to be broken down by enzymes within the digestive tract. Because of this characteristic, Acacia Fibre has been shown in clinical studies to support regularity.
