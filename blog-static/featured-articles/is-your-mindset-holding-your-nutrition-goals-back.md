### GROWTH MINDSET VS FIXED MINDSET

First things first, you need to create a healthy mindset when it comes to eating. In order to have a healthy mindset, you need to first have the ability to have a **“growth mindset.”** People with a growth mindset, as defined by Stanford professor Carol Dweck in her book Mindset, think that their success is contingent on time and effort.

Those with a growth mindset think that by putting in the time, effort, and energy, they can improve at something. They understand that things are always changing around them and the need for adaptability is required. They are aware that failures can and will happen, but understand that is part of the growth process. It is the process that is important here, not the product. They will learn from their failures, so they do not make the same mistake twice. People who have a growth mindset when it comes to nutrition, want to make life-long changes, and improve their lifestyle for the duration.

On the other hand, someone with a **“fixed mindset”** see their qualities as fixed traits that cannot change. They think that their basic nature determines whether they are excellent or poor at anything. Someone with a fixed mindset believes that any kind of adversity is devasting and will often “throw the towel in” at the first sign of it. They are usually focussed on the outcome, rather than the process, and as a result will usually have unrealistic goals when it comes to nutrition. If you feel that you may have a “fixed mindset” then don’t despair, just like everything it takes practice to change.

Once you have a growth mindset, the ability to have a healthy mindset for nutrition will easily follow. You will make daily food choices that align with your goal of changing the process not the outcome. Instead of looking for quick fixes, you will endeavour to learn about the importance of each macro and micro nutrient. You will be honest with yourself with any obstacles and failures on the journey and will adapt and learn from them. You will seek solutions to your barriers.

Sorry, if you were looking for a list of ten things you should stop eating in order to be healthy in 2022 or even a compilation of exotic different “superfoods” to have every morning. But I assure you, practicing and developing a growth mindset is worth way more than any overpriced goji berry smoothie!
