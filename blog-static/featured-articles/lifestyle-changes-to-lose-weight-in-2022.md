### You know about the usual ways to lose weight like using a diet tracker, counting calories, and exercising. But do you know about some minor lifestyle changes you can make to lose weight without even noticing it?

There are lots of little things you can do to lose weight. You can drink more water or less alcohol or get your walk on in the morning or after dinner instead of after work. You can eat three healthy meals a day or six small ones. There's no one-size-fits-all solution.

But it's essential to try out some strategies and find what works for you so that you don't give up when the going gets tough. Here are some small lifestyle changes that can help you lose weight:

### Get moving!

One study found that people who got at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise a week lost more weight over two years than those who were more sedentary. It doesn't take much â€” just a brisk 30-minute walk will get your heart rate up.

If you want to lose weight, the most important thing you can do is get moving. Exercise is more effective at helping people maintain a healthy weight than cutting calories alone. And if you're not in the habit of exercising, adding it to your routine can be difficult.

A big part of doing exercise, regular activity is incorporating it into your daily routine. Setting aside time each day to work out might seem intimidating or impossible, but it's easier than you think. Take a walk during your lunch break; go for a bike ride on weekends instead of going to the movies; make time for home workouts on weeknights after work. It all adds up!

### Eat breakfast!

Studies show that people who eat breakfast every day are less likely to be overweight than those who skip the most important meal of the day.

It's easy to lose track of time when you're busy. When you wake up late, the day can get away from you if you don't fuel up. And if your breakfast is just coffee and a muffin on the run, the chances are that you're not getting the nutrition your body needs.

The purpose of breakfast is to jump-start your metabolism. A healthy breakfast sets up an internal system that promotes weight loss.

If you're short on time, a bowl of whole-grain cereal with fruit is an excellent alternative to a sandwich or a bagel. If you have more time in the morning, cook an egg-white omelet or make a smoothie with protein powder and fruit for an added energy boost.

If you don't like eating at home, pack your lunch the night before, so there's less chance that you'll be tempted by fast food. Include plenty of fresh veggies, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats.

### Lessen your TV watch time and do something productive instead

There are many things that you can do to lose weight. One of them is decreasing your TV watching time. Yes, it is possible. You just need to keep yourself busy when you usually spend watching TV. Instead of watching TV, you might want to clean your house or do some gardening.

### Buy smaller dinner plates

If you want to lose weight, there's a common piece of advice that you'll repeatedly hear: Eat less food.

You might think that this is obvious, but it can be easier said than done. It isn't easy to incorporate new lifestyle habits into your life, especially when they involve giving up something you enjoy (like eating delicious food).

Buy smaller dinner plates. One of the easiest ways to help yourself eat less at each meal is to change the size of your plate. Many people eat until their plate is empty, regardless of what or how much they put on it. However, if your plate is bigger, it will take longer to finish because everything looks stretched out in comparison. If you make your plate 20% smaller and fill it with the same amount of food, you'll probably find that you're full before finishing all the food on your plate. This simple change alone could make a big difference in helping you lose weight.

### Eat at home more often

One of the easiest ways to lose weight is to eat at home more often. When you go out to dinner, most restaurants serve meals that are higher in calories than what you need in a day. When you are eating at home, however, preparing your own food allows you to choose the amount of calories that go into the food and measure them out to fit into your calorie goal for the day. If you do eat out, order from the restaurant's menu instead of from its buffet or appetizer station, where it is easy to overeat and consume high-calorie foods without realizing it.

### Drink water before each meal

Water helps flush fat from your body so that you can burn it up as energy. It also keeps your digestive system in balance, which better eliminates waste from your body. In addition, water is vital for healthy skin, hair, nails, and muscles, so when you drink plenty of water, you look and feel better too.

### Take public transportation when possible

Take public transportation instead of driving whenever possible. Parking at work can be a major money sinkhole if you don't have unlimited spaces available to you. Taking the bus or subway is not only good for your health, but it saves you money!
