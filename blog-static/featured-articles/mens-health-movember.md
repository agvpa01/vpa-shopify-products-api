## Movember beyond the stache.

Movember is an organization that aims to bring awareness to many men’s health issues- from [prostate cancer](https://au.movember.com/about/prostate-cancer), [testicular cancer](https://au.movember.com/about/testicular-cancer), [mental health & suicide prevention](https://au.movember.com/about/mental-health), and providing them with [overall support](https://au.movember.com/mens-health/mental-health) in tough times. Men’s health isn’t spoken about as openly as women’s, and it’s time that we broke down those barriers and increased the dialogue around typically male health issues. In increasing the dialogue, men and boys will be more comfortable in discussing their health with loved ones and health professionals, and this will only lead to more positive health outcomes.

## The Hard Facts:

### Prostate Cancer

According to the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia (PCFA), approximately 3,500 Australian men die of prostate cancer each year. Studies show that the older the man, the greater the risk for acquiring prostate cancer.

#### What factors increase the risk for prostate cancer?

While some [risk factors for prostate cancer](https://www.canceraustralia.gov.au/affected-cancer/cancer-types/prostate-cancer/risk-factors) are modifiable, such as lifestyle and diets, some which cannot be modified are the following:
- **Genetics** – Every one inherits genes from both parents. Depending on the family history, men who have fathers or brother diagnosed with prostate cancer are unfortunately likely to develop it.
- **Age** - prostate cancer is an age-dependent cancer. The risk of developing prostate cancer rapidly increases from age 50.

### How do you reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer?

Like all things, improving the quality and overall health is the best way to avoid any health issue. According to the PCFA, [healthy diets](https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/guidelines/australian-guide-healthy-eating) and at least 30 minutes of regular physical activity or regular exercise can be protective factors for cancer.

### Testicular Cancer

Testicular cancer strikes young. According to a report published in 2012 by the [Australian Institute of Health and Welfare](https://www.aihw.gov.au/getmedia/5fd0fcfe-bac9-4a4c-8128-1152d0ae9d8d/14178.pdf.aspx?inline=true), it is most commonly diagnosed in men aged 20–39. Study shows an alarming number of young Australians [diagnosed with testicular cancer](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/testicular-cancer/#:~:text=In%20Australia%2C%20about%20850%20men,testicle%20can%20get%20testicular%20cancer.) each year. The report also recorded 34 deaths from testicular cancer in Australia in 2018.

It is highly advised to perform regular testicular self-examinations (TSE) to ensure your testicles are healthy. Learn how you can conduct this quick and simple process [here](https://www.healthymale.org.au/mens-health/testicular-cancer).

### What are the symptoms of Testicular Cancer?

Testicular cancer symptoms usually start with a painless swelling or hard lump in either [testicle](https://www.healthymale.org.au/resources-tools/glossary#T). Other symptoms include feeling heaviness in the scrotum, feeling of unevenness, constant backaches, pain, or ache in the lower abdomen, coughing or breathlessness, and enlarged or tender nipples, which could mean that the cancer has spread.

If you observe these symptoms, it is good to see a doctor straight away.
