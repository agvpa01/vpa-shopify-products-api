### How does mind-muscle connection work?

As with anything there is in life, you need to have the right mindset to make the most out of whatever it is you’re doing. We have all experienced an off day at the gym. When you’re stressed, have too much on your mind, and are not feeling the workout, your performance won’t be as good either.

The idea behind the mind-muscle connection is simple – when one consciously focuses on moving the targeted muscle during exercise, the [quality of the contraction is enhanced.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26700744/) By using concentrated, internal focus during each rep makes the muscle work as hard as possible.

### Tips on how to create a better mind-muscle connection for Muscle & Strength

1. Move Slowly
   Firstly, be mindful of your form and we cannot stress this enough so as not to risk any injuries. When doing a movement, move slowly and it helps to pause to achieve peak contraction. Rushing on the reps won’t do you any good. The more time your muscles are under tension, the more they have to work and the more time you have to mentally connect to the muscle movement.

2. Tempo and tension
   When you’re building muscles, tension is your best friend. You’ll want that muscle activated and under stress to see results.
   A good workout formula to achieve tension would be:
   - **FAST**: Perform the movement relatively quickly.
   - **HOLD**: Squeeze and hold at the climax of the movement.
   - **SLOW**: Resist and perform a slow movement back to feel the muscle fibers stretching.
   - **REPEAT!

3. Flex your muscle targets in between sets
   Yup, flexing is part of the process and be proud of your gains! The mirrors are there for a reason. Take a few seconds between sets to flex the muscles you’ve been working on. Conscious posing between sets helps not to break that momentum.

4. SUPPLEMENTATION WITH PRE-WORKOUTS
   Any supplement containing ingredients that improve cognition (focus, memory, alertness) will help you stay in focus while training. Most of these are found in pre-workouts. They not only help boost your focus but also endurance and strength. VPA® has a great range of [pre-workouts](https://www.vpa.com.au/collections/pre-intra-supplements).
