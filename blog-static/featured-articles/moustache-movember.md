## Moustache Movember

Moustache Movember is an annual event where men grow moustaches to raise awareness for different health issues. Behind this movement is a group of men who push for early cancer detection and diagnosis. They also aim for early treatment that can result in the reduction of untimely deaths among men.

One of the reasons it is so popular is that it does not only focus on [prostate cancer](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/mens-health-movember) but also other health issues that might affect men, including mental health, testicular cancer, and suicide prevention.

Movember strives to create a dialogue around mental health issues that have long been stigmatized or neglected due to a lack of understanding or resources. Movember provides resources for those looking for help and offers education on the prevention of depression and suicide. This year, letâ€™s take a closer look at the mental health issues that men face.
