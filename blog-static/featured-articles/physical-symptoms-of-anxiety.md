## What is Anxiety?

Simply put, anxiety refers to the feelings of fear, worry, and uneasiness that are often caused by stressful thoughts or situations. Anxiety problems can range from mild to severe.

There are two common types of anxiety disorders.

1. The first type of anxiety disorder is called Panic Disorder, which is characterized by panic attacks.
2. The second type of anxiety disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, is when people worry about many different things.

## Common Causes of Anxiety

About [33.7%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4610617/) of people experience one or two anxiety attacks in their lifetime.

Anxiety attacks are sometimes caused by panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or social phobia. Anxiety attacks can be induced by an external stimulus such as a loud noise or a traumatic event.

Some of the common causes of anxiety attacks are:

### 1) Stress

This can be caused by major life changes like getting married, starting college, and financial difficulties.

### 2) Family history

If someone has parents or siblings who have had it before them, there is a higher chance of developing it themselves.

### 3) Medical Conditions

Sometimes, it is related to an illness that the person has which needs to be addressed medically to reduce the severity and frequency of the attack. Many things can cause anxiety, and the above mentioned are just the most common ones. It can also be caused by environmental factors, thoughts, perfectionism, negative past experiences, genetics and other biological factors.

The most common types of anxiety are panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and social anxiety disorder. GAD typically does not have any specific cause, but PTSD can be caused by witnessing a traumatic event or having a history of trauma in the person's life. There are a couple of [physical symptoms](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anxiety/symptoms-causes/syc-20350961) that you can watch out for.

## Physical Symptoms of Anxiety

### Rapid heartbeat

It is not uncommon for people to experience heart palpitations when they are experiencing Anxiety. This is because of the fight or flight response that happens in our bodies when we are in this state. All of our energy goes to either running away or fighting an attacker, which is why it can make us feel like we are about to have a heart attack.

### Dizziness

Dizziness is a common symptom of Anxiety. Its occurrence can be attributed to the fact that Anxiety leads to changes in blood flow in the brain. During an anxiety attack, this change in blood flow in the brain can trigger sensations of vertigo or light-headedness in some people.

### Sweating

The process of sweating helps maintain homeostasis in the body by dissipating heat. It's also possible that people sweat when they are feeling anxious because of the release of adrenaline that occurs in situations where our fight-or-flight response kicks in.

### Nausea

Nausea is one of the most common feelings during an anxiety attack. People experience nausea because of a change in their body's balance which can be triggered by a number of factors. Nausea also has a strong psychological effect on people as panic and fear often accompanies it. This may cause people to feel more anxious or stressed, which will then lead to more nausea.

### Panic

It is not uncommon for people to experience panic during an anxiety attack. The feeling of "impending doom" that comes with panic can cause them to feel like they are losing control of themselves. It can also happen spontaneously, not just when there's an anxiety attack. Panic attacks are sudden periods of intense fear and discomfort that usually last about 10 minutes but can be much shorter or longer than this time frame, depending on the person.

### Rapid breathing

People often experience rapid breathing during an anxiety attack because their breathing becomes faster when they become frightened or uneasy about something. Heart attack and anxiety attacks may have the same set of symptoms, but the main difference is, these symptoms won't go away with a heart attack. If you experience any of these symptoms that only last for a couple of minutes, you might be experiencing an anxiety attack.
