In the hustle and bustle of modern life, it's easy to overlook the simple yet profound benefits of something as basic as sunlight. Specifically, the gentle rays of the morning sun have a remarkable impact on our well-being, both physically and mentally. Beyond just illuminating our surroundings, morning sunlight offers a host of benefits that can enhance our mood, improve our health, and invigorate our daily routines.

## What are the health benefits of morning sunlight?

### Morning sun exposure boosts the immune system
Morning sun exposure can boost our immune system primarily through the synthesis of vitamin D. Sunlight is the most potent source of Vitamin D, a nutrient vital for healthy bones and teeth. When our skin is exposed to sunlight, specifically ultraviolet B (UVB) rays, it triggers a process in which cholesterol in the skin is converted into vitamin D. Vitamin D is a crucial nutrient that plays a central role in immune function.

### Morning sun is a natural mood enhancer
Sunlight exposure, particularly during the morning hours, is closely linked to the production and regulation of serotonin in the body. Sunlight enters the eyes and triggers a series of biochemical reactions that lead to the release of serotonin from specialised cells known as serotonergic neurons. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter, often referred to as the "feel-good" hormone, that plays a crucial role in regulating mood, appetite, sleep, and cognitive functions. The impact of the lack of sun exposure is closely linked to [Seasonal Affective Disorder](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4673349/).

### Morning sun exposure helps regulate the body's Circadian Rhythm
Sunlight exposure helps regulate the body's internal clock, known as the [circadian rhythm](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/understanding-biological-rhythms-circadian-rhythm-vs-infradian-rhythm). Sun exposure helps synchronise the circadian rhythm, signalling to the body that it's time to wake up and start the day. This synchronisation of the circadian rhythm is crucial for maintaining optimal serotonin levels and promoting overall well-being.

### Morning sunlight in lowering blood pressure
Recent studies have shown that morning sunlight can help [lower blood pressure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2290997/). The skin exposed to sunlight releases a compound called nitric oxide into the bloodstream, which can lower blood pressure levels.

### The Correlation Between Morning Sunlight and Weight Loss
Morning sunlight or Vitamin D can also help in maintaining a healthy weight. A study has shown that exposure to early morning sunlight was found to reduce the risk of developing obesity and cardiometabolic dysfunction. As the blue-light wavelength permeates our skin and reaches the fat beneath, lipid droplets diminish and exit the cells. Essentially, sunlight aids in eliminating excess body fat. A shortage of this essential component is also associated with obesity. Furthermore, the correlation is evident as individuals tend to gain more weight in the winter months due to diminished UV ray exposure.
