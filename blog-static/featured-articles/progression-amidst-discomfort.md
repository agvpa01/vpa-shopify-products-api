### THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSISTENCY

Have you felt like your performance for exercise has been feeling more like a chore rather than this magical journey of fitness and well-being? Perhaps an inconsistency between your regular gym visits or home workouts? It's a common problem among people of all ages and all bubbles of interest but, it sure does suck to re-evaluate yourself and question what you used to find passion in. That is where self-discipline comes in, the ability to push yourself forward and stay motivated – a skill to be honed, and most importantly, a skill to be used in conjunction with consistency. Consistency helps you build momentum to accomplish your fitness goals, develop routines, and habits that should make you involuntarily achieve your goals.

At the same time, [make sure to switch things up](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/training/the-10-secrets-of-exercise-motivation) a little bit – under consistency of course. Doing the same workouts, again and again, does get boring, and it's the reason why people often feel as if they’ve hit a workout plateau and fail to see results. Reward yourself for the little things, whether it’s through a [good nutritious meal or a snack](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/recipes), or [fitness gear](https://www.vpa.com.au/collections/apparel-and-accessories) to help propel you even further. Continue to set up small attainable goals and enjoy the satisfaction of reaching your goals, and if you ever feel like quitting, think about why you started in the first place.

### BEING UNCOMFORTABLE IS GOOD FOR YOU

We often associate discomfort as a hassle but in a different perspective, discomfort is simply a sign of progress. Have you heard of the famous saying “No pain, No gain”? It’s precisely the point of self-discipline and self-growth – the main driving force for our journey in fitness. The next thing we need to do now is to get comfortable being uncomfortable. Confidence is everything and getting used to discomfort will help you in your journey to fitness! Never forget to keep putting new milestones and prove yourself wrong about what you thought was impossible. Whether your journey is in [weight loss](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/best-weight-loss-supplements), [muscle bulking](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/diet-and-nutrition/how-to-lose-fat-and-gain-muscle), or the mental health benefits fitness provides, give yourself a pat on the back, you’ve done an excellent job coming this far into the journey!

No, in fact resting after a good exercise is one of the most vital ingredients for good momentum. Rest is fuel for consistency and it's crucial to practice and to perceive what a good rest is. Rest can range anywhere from within minutes of break in between your sets to a day or two of relaxation and rehabilitation from a good workout. Rest facilitates [muscle growth and repair](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/the-importance-of-sleep-is-sleep-the-reason-you-re-not-seeing-results-in-the-gym), gets the blood flowing and allows momentum for your next training session.
