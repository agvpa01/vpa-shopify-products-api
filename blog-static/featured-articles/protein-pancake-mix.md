### Why Should I Use a Protein Pancake Mix?

Since protein is essential for muscle building and our body's daily functions, it's important to incorporate enough protein into our diets. However, getting all the protein you need in every meal can be challenging, especially during breakfast. Because many breakfast foods are carb-heavy and lack protein, they're not very filling. This may cause you to be hungry soon after eating breakfast or even reach for an unhealthy snack to curb hunger until lunchtime. We've all been there!

Protein pancakes can help combat this problem by providing an easy way to get your fill of protein first thing in the morning. Plus, it'll help keep you full so that you won't feel the need for that mid-morning snack break!

Psyllium husk and inulin

Inulin is a polysaccharide that comes from plants, such as potatoes and bananas. It's found naturally in some fruits and vegetables. Inulin has the ability to help digestive issues by stopping cravings for sugar, which causes bloating and inflammation. And it regulates bowel movements, which is essential for people suffering from diarrhea.

Psyllium husk is a fiber that comes from seeds. Adding some psyllium husk to your diet can help reduce cholesterol levels, which means less blood clots, less heart damage, and fewer strokes. It also can improve digestion by thinning out mucus in the intestines so wastes can move through more easily.

### Why is it better than a regular pancake mix?

The typical breakfast pancake is high in carbohydrates and calories, low in fat and protein, and has little to no fiber. Protein pancakes contain more protein than their carb-laden counterparts, plus essential vitamins and minerals.

They can be lower in carbohydrates, depending on the recipe used. A protein pancake can also contain more healthy fats than a traditional breakfast pancake.

Protein Pancake Mix has a higher nutritional value overall compared to a traditional pancake.

If you're trying to eat healthier, a great place to start is by replacing your normal breakfast with a protein-packed meal. Pancakes are a quick, easy and delicious option for your morning meal, but many people find that their typical batter recipe is too heavy or too sweet.

If this sounds like you, consider switching to a protein pancake mix instead. They're packed with more protein and less sugar — making them a much healthier choice.
