### First, what are the causes of Sleep Deprivation?

Sleep deprivation is seen more common globally now more than ever as people sacrifice their sleeping schedules to do more work. It also affects growing teens because the lack of sleep may stunt their growth and disrupt hormonal changes essential to a growing person.

Sleep deprivation is not a disease but rather an effect of a cause. It can be caused by several reasons, namely:

### 1. Sleep disorders

Sleep disorders like insomnia, narcolepsy, and sleep apnea are the leading causes of sleep deprivation. These disorders make falling asleep difficult or make you wake up early, disabling you from getting enough sleep.

### 2. Stress and hormonal imbalance

Stress has several effects that coincide with your sleep, especially the production of cortisol, the stress hormone. Usually, cortisol is an important hormone when balanced, however, a hormonal imbalance of cortisol can affect your sleep by affecting normal melatonin levels in your body.

### 3. Other illnesses

Illnesses like depression, cancer, Alzheimer's, and schizophrenia affect your sleep by messing with hormonal levels in your body. Fear and anxiety are commonly linked to sleep loss due to depression. If you have ever spent a night tossing and turning, you already know how you’ll feel the next day — tired, cranky, and out of sorts. These are the more obvious effects of sleep deprivation however, regularly missing out on the [recommended 7-8 hours of sleep](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/the-importance-of-sleep-is-sleep-the-reason-you-re-not-seeing-results-in-the-gym) can lead to more serious consequences when our bodily functions start to suffer.

### Sleep deprivation experiments

You’ve probably heard of the horrors of the ‘Russian Sleep Experiment’, a popular creepy urban myth that circulated around the internet in the early 2010’s which we will leave to you to read more in detail however, (spoiler alert) while the horrific experiment did not actually take place, there are a few people who have gone more than week without sleep, and one such experiment was done by a student named [Randy Gardner](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180118-the-boy-who-stayed-awake-for-11-days). The boy stayed awake for 11 days or 264 hours for his high school science project in 1963 which made history.

During the experiment, he suffered from foggy memory, poor concentration, dizziness, slurred speech, and even hallucinations and paranoia. After the project was over, Gardner slept for 14 hours straight and woke up feeling normal again, without any long-lasting consequences of sleep deprivation.

### Effects of Sleep Loss

Putting this experiment aside, [research has shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19961/) that sleep loss (less than 7 hours per night) or prolonged sleep deprivation has major negative effects on the cardiovascular, endocrine, immune, and nervous systems, including the following:

- Weakens immune system
- Obesity in adults and children
- Diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance
- Cardiovascular disease and hypertension
- Increased amount of the stress hormone cortisol
- High blood pressure
- Depression, anxiety and other mental illnesses
