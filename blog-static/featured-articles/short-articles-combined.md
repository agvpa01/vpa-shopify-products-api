## Stay Hydrated in winter with these 5 easy steps

---

### 1. Establish a daily drinking goal

This is an easy one to do. Research indicates we need to drink 2L of water a day. There are many apps available to track your water intake. A simple way to track your water intake is to carry a water bottle with you. We have a [black insulated water bottle](https://www.vpa.com.au) if you are looking for a new one. It keeps your drinks icy cold and feels great in your hand due to the rubber feel coating.

Set a target number of glasses or cups of water throughout each day — for example, five glasses at meals during the day and two glasses before bedtime. Set an alarm on your phone to remind you to drink throughout the day instead of waiting until you're thirsty before sipping some water from the tap (which can be too late).

---

### 2. Replace the water that you lose

During physical activity we lose water through sweat. Before you undertake any exercise ensure you are adequately hydrated. During the workout drink consume some fluids. There is no magic number of how much to drink as it depends on the duration, intensity, weather and type of clothes worn. As a general rule the goal is to [prevent fluid loss](https://journals.lww.com/acsm-healthfitness/fulltext/2013/07000/exercise_and_fluid_replacement__brought_to_you_by.3.aspx) of greater than 2% body weight. Post workout the goal is to replace lost water and electrolytes. If you are looking for a hydrating post workout drink [Protein Water](/products/protein-water) is a fantastic option.

Staying hydrated is important year-round, but especially during the winter months when we're losing more water through sweat and breathing. So it's important to replenish your body with plenty of fluids — water, coffee, tea or even hot chocolate (as long as you steer clear of the sugary syrups).

### With most people around the world being housebound, there are only two options – stay bored or get creative. Whether you’re in self isolation or just simply avoiding the crowd, here are 5 things you can do in quarantine with us to help bring out your creative side.

---

## 1. Record your home workout and upload it to our NEW VPA® TV platform for FREE

## 2. Write a blog for us – we will pay $25 per blog article approved by our team

Ever wanted to write a blog about something but haven’t started on it yet? Now would be the perfect time! Wanna share a workout challenge? How about a nutritious recipe for us to try out?

You could write about how you are feeling and what you are doing to keep yourself busy while you are quarantined. You could also share your experience with other people who have been quarantined. This will help them know what to expect and how they can make the best of their situation as well.

Keep track of all the things that you do during your quarantine period so that when you get out, you can share them with others who might be interested in reading about them. This may include things such as exercise routines, recipes that use foods that are available during quarantine, or even just daily journal entries about what it's like being isolated from everyone else in the world for several months at a time!

Any health and fitness topics are welcome, but we don’t mind topics outside this area as well so long as it’s helpful and relevant information.

Submit your entries to [sales@vpa.com.au](mailto:sales@vpa.com.au)

**SEO Title:** 7 Weight Loss Myths

**SEO Description:** In this blog, we discuss 7 weight loss myths, including eating less and exercising more, giving up alcohol, and more.

## Content

## Myth #1: Eat less and exercise more

Although studies do show that people who change their eating habits and increase their exercise often maintain weight loss, there is more to the weight loss story. There are other factors such as genetics, environment, mental health and food intolerances which play a role in one’s ability to lose weight. Some researchers argue that the common advice to just “count calories” isn’t helpful, because it ignores the many issues, including biology, that contribute to a person’s weight. Researchers argue that rather than focusing on a calories-in versus calories-out equation, more attention should be paid to the overall composition of a person’s diet.

## Myth #2: All calories are equal

Calories as far as an energy source they can be looked at as all the same, but the way they interact with your body is not. Consider 300 calories of sugar compared to 300 calories from an avocado, they will react with your body very differently. The sugar will be stored as fat if it is not used shortly after being consumed as it is fast-digesting energy, whereas avocado is slow digesting energy so it will fuel your body for hours and is less likely to be stored as fat. Also, fat-digesting sugars will mess with your energy levels and will leave you tired…making it more likely to snack and less likely to exercise.

## Myth #3: You need to lose substantial weight to notice health changes

Research shows that with just a 10% loss of weight, people will experience noticeable changes in their blood pressure and blood sugar control while lowering their risk for heart disease and Type 2 diabetes.

## Myth #4: There’s a single best diet

The best diet is the one you are most likely to stick to. Only 45% of people in the National Weight Control Registry say they lost weight following various diets on their own, and 55% say they used a structured weight-loss program. Dr. Yoni Freedhoff, an obesity expert and the medical director of the Bariatric Medical Institute in Ottawa, starts men and women at his clinic on the same plan, but lets everyone diverge from it. “We have a plan that involves getting enough calories and protein and so forth, but we are not married to it,” he said in a recent TIME cover story on weight loss. “Everyone here is doing things slightly differently.”

## Myth #5: We are overweight because we eat too much

Obviously you cannot eat all day and lose weight, but there is more to it. High-calorie processed foods and drinks have become a ubiquitous part of the Western diet, and some researchers say weight gain may also be linked to our exposure to chemicals like the bisphenol A (BPA) found in everyday items like canned-food containers and cash-register receipts. We are also becoming more sedentary.

## Myth #6: You have to give up alcohol to lose weight

According to *New York Times* reports, several studies have shown that while heavy drinking is linked to weight gain, people who drink light and moderate amounts of alcohol are not likely to gain weight. Of course, the usual advice remains: everything in moderation. It’s also good to keep in mind that people can react differently to the same foods. For some people, the casual glass of wine won’t have a big effect, but for others it might.

## Myth #7: People need more willpower to lose weight

This is a big one…There are many factors—genetic, environmental and physical that play into a person’s weight and ability to move, and there is a growing body of research showing that when people lose weight, biological factors come into play, making it harder for them to keep weight off after it’s gone.

Kevin Hall, a scientist at the National Institutes of Health, has found that when a person loses a substantial amount of weight, their metabolism gets out of whack and their appetite increases proportionally, causing them to eat about 100 calories more for every two pounds lost. While that doesn’t mean it’s impossible to keep weight off in the long term, it does mean that struggling to do so is by no means a reflection of willpower, motivation or work ethic.

**SEO Description:** Have you had the experience where you were not overly hungry until you had a handful of chips or a banana, then found yourself ravenous?

### Have you had the experience where you were not overly hungry until you had a handful of chips or a banana, then found yourself ravenous?

Well, you can actually make your brain and gut “hungry” simply by taking a few bites of food by “activating” parts of your biology that drives your hunger for more, says Dr. Belinda Lennerz, an endocrinologist and researcher at Harvard Medical School.

“The sight, smell, or taste of some food will trigger the cephalic food response,” she explains, referring to the biological processes triggered in your gut when it thinks more food is coming. In the same way, by swallowing a few bites of food you can make your brain want to consume more in order to repeat or sustain the reward sensation.

---

**Potato Chips, Crackers, And Bread**

Potato chips contain high levels of fat, sodium and calories, which are not good for your heart. They also contain trans fats, which can increase bad cholesterol levels in your body and increase your risk of heart disease. To avoid these problems, try eating only a few small servings of potato chips each day instead of munching on them continuously throughout the day.

When you eat refined carbs your blood sugar levels shoot up. “The body’s reaction to this is to release a large amount of insulin to normalize blood sugar,” Lennerz says. This is an issue because Insulin shuttles that blood sugar into “storage,” says Dr. David Ludwig, a professor of nutrition at Harvard. Since that energy has now been locked away, your hunger for food screams back with a vengeance. (See: [Science Explains Why You Can’t Stop Eating Potato Chips](https://time.com/4249709/salt-fat-overeating-sodium/))

---

**Cookies, Cake, and Sweets**

Sugar is another food that causes hunger because it's energy dense (meaning there's a lot of calories per serving). Foods with sugar also tend to be high in fat and salt, further increasing their caloric content.

Research from Yale University School of Medicine shows that any form of sugar, including honey activates your brain’s reward and appetite pathways differently to other sources of energy.

Your thalamus, hypothalamus, and insula are the areas that drive you to eat and then relax after you’ve consumed food. But when you swallow high sugar food those areas stay active, in other words, your brain tells your body you’re not full.

---

**Low-Fat, Single-Serve Yogurt**

Here's why you shouldn't eat yogurt in the morning: The sugar content in yogurt is high, which can cause blood sugar levels to spike. A sudden increase in blood sugar can leave you feeling hungry again soon after eating.

One recent review found that lots of chewing decreases the levels of ghrelin released when eating—the so-called “hunger hormone.” (See: [The Case Against Low-Fat Dairy Is Stronger Than Ever](https://time.com/4279538/low-fat-milk-vs-whole-milk/)) So the time and the number of chews it takes you to eat something affects how full you feel.

Small cup-sized yogurt are dangerously because they are so easy to consume, quickly and without any chewing. The low-fat varieties also tend to be packed with sugar and other processed carbs, which promote hunger for all the reasons mentioned above. A good rule of thumb: the more quickly you can swallow something, the more likely you are to eat more of it.

---

**Diet Soda and Artificially Sweetened Snacks**

Drinking diet soda is one of the worst things you can do for your waistline. Some studies have shown that drinking just two diet sodas a day can increase your risk of developing diabetes by 33 percent, according to CNN. The reason for this is the artificial sweeteners in diet sodas, which can cause insulin levels to spike quickly after drinking them and then crash, leaving people feeling hungry again quickly.

A recent Australian study found that when artificial sweeteners hit your tongue, your brain’s reward centers light up and signal to your gut to expect some energy to arrive. The problem is that when those calories don’t show up your brain forces you to consume more food to fill the void. In this way, [no-calorie sweeteners like the ones in diet soda may send your hunger soaring](https://time.com/3628546/diet-soda-bad-for-you).

### We’ve all heard of how hard it is to lose weight or to keep in shape as we get older, and many people have thought of this as an excuse…but science is now revealing why people have said this for so many years.

New research at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden has identified why people gain weight as they get older. Apparently, the lipid turnover in the fat tissue decreases during ageing and makes it easier to gain weight, even if we don’t eat more or exercise less than before. The study is published in the journal *Nature Medicine*.

After studying the fat cells in 54 men and women over 13 years, all subjects showed decreases in lipid turnover in the fat tissue, that is the rate at which fat in the fat cells is removed and stored, and the subject that didn’t compensate for that by eating less calories gained weight by an average of 20 percent.

“The results indicate for the first time that processes in our fat tissue regulate changes in body weight during ageing in a way that is independent of other factors,” says Peter Arner, professor at the Department of Medicine in Huddinge at Karolinska Institutet and one of the study’s main authors. “This could open up new ways to treat obesity.”

But there is hope because other research has shown that one way to speed up the lipid turnover in the fat tissue is to exercise more.

“Obesity and obesity-related diseases have become a global problem,” says Kirsty Spalding, senior researcher at the Department of Cell and Molecular Biology at Karolinska Institutet and another of the study’s main authors. “Understanding lipid dynamics and what regulates the size of the fat mass in humans has never been more relevant.”

### People who commit to lose weight aren’t just helping themselves, they are helping others around them too.

That’s the finding of a new University of Connecticut study that tracked the weight loss progress of 130 couples over six months. Researchers from the University of Connecticut found that when one person of a relationship commits to losing weight, it significantly increased the chances of the other person in the relationship losing weight too, even if they were not participating in a weight loss intervention. They found that one-third of the partners (not-committed to weight loss) lost 3 percent or more of their starting body weight after six months even though they did not participate in any active exercise and three percent loss of body weight is considered a measurable health benefit.

The study’s lead investigator, UConn Professor Amy Gorin, calls it a “ripple effect.”

“When one person changes their behavior, the people around them change,” says Gorin, a behavioral psychologist. “Whether the patient works with their healthcare provider, joins a community-based, lifestyle approach like Weight Watchers, or tries to lose weight on their own, their new healthy behaviors can benefit others in their lives.”

This study found that the speed at which couples lost weight is interlinked, meaning that if one member lost weight at a steady pace, their partner did too.

“How we change our eating and exercise habits can affect others in both positive and negative ways,” says Gorin, who studies environmental and social factors influencing weight loss. “On the positive side, spouses might emulate their partner’s behaviors and join them in counting calories, weighing themselves more often, and eating lower-fat foods.”

Previous findings of a weight loss ripple effect were limited to patients who participated in closely monitored, clinic-based interventions and those who had bariatric surgery. Most of those studies relied on couples self-reporting their weight loss, raising the possibility of error.

### Make dieting easier and crush your hunger

---

1) Focus on losing fat at a slowly

By cutting too many calories you will lose your lean muscle along with the fat, and be a lot more hungry than necessary. Focus on creating a small calorie deficit that gradually strips the fat away while maintaining your lean muscle and keeping your hunger levels relatively controlled. Maintain a small calorie deficit of about 15-20% below your maintenance level.

You can't out-train a bad diet. If you eat too much, you'll gain weight. If you eat too little, you'll lose muscle and slow down your metabolism. So if you're trying to lose weight, focus on eating less and exercising more — not the other way around. One pound per week is ideal because it can be achieved without too much effort, but it's still fast enough to notice results quickly (a few weeks).

---

### Consume around 1 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight daily.

This will also ensure you maintain lean muscle, plus protein is much lower in calories than the other two macronutrients, fats and carbs.

Protein helps to build muscle mass, which can increase your metabolism and help you burn more calories. Aim to get 20-30% of your calories from protein in order to maintain or build muscle mass.

### A study on Functional Imagery Training (FIT) for Weight Loss

A study has shown that overweight people lost an average of 5X more weight using Functional Imagery Training (FIT), which teaches self-motivating skills using mental imagery — compared with talking therapy alone. Plus these users of FIT lost 4.3cm more around their waist circumference in six months and continued to lose weight after the study had finished.

The study involved 141 participants, who were split into two groups either FIT or Motivational Interviewing (MI) — a technique where a therapist guides someone to develop, highlight and verbalise their need or motivation for change, and outlining the reasons for wanting to make the change. But FIT goes one step deeper than MI, and uses multisensory imagery to explore these changes by teaching clients how to create and practise motivational imagery themselves. Everyday behaviours and app reminders were used to cue the imagery practise until it becomes a habit.

Only 4 hours of consultation time was given to each participant and surprisingly neither group received any additional dietary advice or information.

Dr Solbrig said: “It’s fantastic that people lost significantly more weight on this intervention, as, unlike most studies, it provided no diet/physical activity advice or education. People were completely free in their choices and supported in what they wanted to do, not what a regimen prescribed.”

The study revealed that after six months people who used FIT lost an average of 4.11kg, compared with an average of 0.74kg among the MI group. After 12 months the FIT group continued to lose weight, with an average of 6.44kg lost compared with 0.67kg in the MI group.

Dr Solbrig continued: “We started with taking people through an exercise about a lemon. We asked them to imagine seeing it, touching it, juicing it, drinking the juice and juice accidently squirting in their eye, to emphasise how emotional and tight to our physical sensations imagery is. From there we are able to encourage them to fully imagine and embrace their own goals. Not just ‘imagine how good it would be to lose weight’ but, for example, ‘what would losing weight enable you to do that you can’t do now? What would that look / sound / smell like?’, and encourage them to use all of their senses.”

“As well as being delighted by the success of the study in the short term, there are very few studies that document weight loss past the end of treatment, so to see that people continued to lose weight despite not having any support shows the sustainability and effectiveness of this intervention.”

**SEO Title:** The Art of Macro Counting

**SEO Description:** Our body requires fats, proteins and carbohydrates in order to function properly. These three are called macronutrients. Read on our blog as we break down each nutrient and why it's important for our body.

---

## Excerpt

No excerpt available

## Content

## Firstly what are macronutrients?

They are a form of food broken down into fats, proteins and carbohydrates that are required within the diet. Why are these three elements so important within the diet? Well in order to achieve mass growth, [reduce body fat](https://www.vpa.com.au/pages/search-results-page?q=fat+burner) or even maintain current status quo these three major macronutrients are required by the body in order to function.

## Breaking down each nutrient and its importance within the body

### Protein

- Adequate protein intake will help build muscle and or prevent muscle loss
- Protein controls appetite
- Requires large amounts of energy for the body to digest
- High protein diets are a tool in fat loss
- Can be found in sources of meat, fish, poultry, eggs, nuts, vegetables, grains, protein shakes etc
- Protein needs are dependent upon weight, body fat percentage and goals

### Fat

- Fat is an essential nutrient that the body requires to live
- It assists with vitamin absorption, hormone regulation, brain function etc
- Can be found in meat, fish, nuts, seeds, oils, eggs etc
- Fat needs are depended upon weight, body fat percentage and goals

### Carbohydrates

- Carbs are stored in the liver, brain, blood and muscles as glycogen.
- The body uses carbs for energy
- Can be found in sources of fruit, vegetables, grains, processed foods and drinks
- Carb needs are dependent upon activity level, weight, body fat percentage and goals

Each of these macronutrients yields a certain number of calories
- 1g of protein is 4 calories
- 1g of fat is 9 calories
- 1g of carb is 4 calories

## So how to you calculate your daily macro intake?

There are many different formulas to calculate macronutrient intake and there are many different websites, which have created their own calculators to produce these macros.
The most basic formula used to calculate macro intake is the Mifflin, M.D., St Joer formula. This formula calculates resting energy expenditure (REE)
- Males: 10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) – 5 x age (y) +5 = REE
- Females: 10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) – 5 x age (y) – 161 = REE

## After calculating the REE the next step is to work out the movement expenditure or total daily energy expenditure (TDEE).

- Sedentary – REE x 1.2
- Light activity – REE x 1.375
- Moderate activity – REE x 1.55
- Very Active – REE x 1.725

## Once the TDEE is worked out the next step is to determine the goal

- Weight loss = TDEE – (TDEE x .20)
- Weight gain = TDEE + (TDEE x.20)
- Weight maintenance = eat the same

## Now to calculate the macronutrient needs for the body

- **Protein** – A balanced approach is to start with .825g protein per pound of body weight
  i.e. 132lbs (60kg) protein intake will be 132 x .825 = 111g
  Remember 1g of protein is 4 calories therefore 444 calories are taken up for protein
- **Fat** – generally denoting 25% of calorie intake to fat
  i.e. TDEE x 0.25 = calories now divide these by 9 (as 1g of fat = 9 calories) to calculate grams of fat
- **Carbs** – this is determined by adding the calories from protein and fat and whatever is leftover divide this number by 4 (1g carbs = 4 calories) to determine the carbohydrate intake
This is the simple method of determining macronutrient needs. If you are confused and not a numbers person there are lots of coaches out there with expertise and can calculate your daily needs in relation to your specific goal

**SEO Description:** Don't underestimate the importance of sleep. If you're training hard it could be the reason you are not achieving the results you hoped for.

### The importance of sleep

The importance of sleep to our mental and physical health can’t be overemphasized. Sleep plays an essential role in our physical health, emotional well-being, and our cognitive abilities. If you’re training hard, and eating well, failing to get enough quality sleep could be the reason you are not achieving the results you hoped for. This blog will explain the importance of sleep and outline some ways you can improve your sleep patterns to hopefully see better results from your hard work.

### How much sleep do I need?

The average person requires between 7-9 hours of uninterrupted sleep per night; however, it is estimated that 2/3 actually achieve this, and approximately 10% are diagnosed with clinical insomnia.

### The importance of sleep

Studies on sleep have revealed that regularly getting less than 7-8 hours can negatively impact both your athletic performance and general health. During sleep, our body heals, grows, and restores balance to our internal systems, including our hormones.

### Sleep and sports performance

Failing to get enough sleep can have the following impacts on sports performance, training, and progression:

- The ability to make split-second decisions required in fast-paced sports like tennis or football is impaired.
- In endurance athletes, lack of sleep may increase perceived exertion.
- Lack of sleep can reduce performance in time trials over a set distance.
- Lack of sleep decreases the rate at which muscle glycogen is replenished.
- In strength athletes, the maximal weights able to be lifted are significantly lower in those who experience sleep deprivation over several days.
- Athletes who sleep less than 8 hours per night are 70% more likely to experience injury.

### Sleep and health

People who regularly do not get enough sleep are at higher risk of many health issues:

- Sleep deprivation correlates highly with being overweight.
- People who don’t get enough sleep are more likely to have diabetes.
- Chronic inflammation associated with lack of sleep may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
- Immune function is compromised when you don’t get enough sleep.

### How to improve sleep quality

Now that we understand the importance of sleep, there are several behavioral and habit changes that you can make to improve your sleep quality.

1. **Practice good sleep hygiene**: Sleep hygiene refers to practices that help promote good sleep. One hour before you plan to be asleep, put down the mobile phone and charge it in a different room. Wind down with a book and switch off all lights before going to bed. [Know more](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/sleep-hygiene) about better sleep hygiene rituals.

2. **Have a bedtime routine**: Forming a bedtime routine is one of the most effective things you can do to promote good sleep habits. Try to go to bed at the same time every night.

3. **Avoid coffee and other stimulants**: Caffeine can disrupt sleep, so avoid caffeinated beverages late in the day and before bed.

### Supplements for sleep

Taking supplements to improve sleep quality should be secondary to making the behavioral changes mentioned above. However, there are several supplements worth considering to improve your sleep quality.

#### Casein for better sleep

[Casein](/products/micellar-casein) is a type of protein found in cow's milk. It is a high-quality, bioavailable protein that contains all of the essential amino acids. Unlike whey protein, which is rapidly digested, casein is slowly digested and absorbed. This makes it the ideal protein to have at night before you sleep. People who have high protein diets generally have better sleep quality.

Don’t you just hate it when you forget to start your calorie counter before you begin exercising? I mean, you may as well not have exercised at all. Of course, there is the question of how accurate something attached to our wrist can be measuring something at an atomic level. My educated & common sense guess is that it cannot specifically tell us, but can give us a general estimate. However, a more critical question might be, is your body burning the calories you want it to burn? Or did you forget to tell it?

The age of mass-protest, mass-market, mass-hysteria, mass-production and most ‘likes’ has proven to take a toll on quality right across the board. Quantity is winning the war by a far stretch. Whoever speaks the loudest and most often, wins. Despite all the new age information on the diet war, there is still a preoccupation with calorie quantity over calorie quality. Society kind of knows we should eat well, but the overall calorie count on the package still reigns supreme. Unfortunately, in the government’s haste to inform the consumer they forgot to emphasize a few key facts about calories in food.

Calories have always existed in the food chain. Our prehistoric ancestors kept a nice reserve of calories on their bodies but didn’t quite have the mental or technological processing power to define or formularize it. Nor did they need to, as their value to the tribe didn’t necessarily hinge on how big their bum looked in a grass skirt. It wasn’t until the 1800s until we defined a formula for the kilo-calorie aka Calorie. The 1900s saw the kcal become ingrained in the food packaging & production culture. However, this is where food science and food consumption became curdled.

As governments and their trusted nutritional institutions became increasingly aware of energy consumption and storage, they saw it necessary to display the foods energy breakdown on packaging so that the consumer could make a more informed choice. However, the misinformed consumer mistakenly assumed that measuring a foods calorie content based on a lab experiment involving a Bunsen burner, had a very close correlation with how the calories may be used or stored on our body. Not so my dear Watson!

We all know that 200 calories of chicken breast is ‘better’ for us than 200 calories of table sugar, but we aren’t taking it on board and the ‘authorities’ really aren’t helping the matter. There is sound advice and labelling pertaining to macronutrient breakdown and, to a lesser degree, micronutrient breakdown. But despite that information the focus, in the consumer’s mind, remains squarely on calories in versus calories out, which is entirely wide of the mark.

If a petrol station displayed a sign saying, “your car will go 10% further on diesel”, would you view that sign as misleading? The fact is, a diesel engine with 50L of fuel probably does go about 10% further than an unleaded engine in the same make and model and with the same volume of petrol. Though the sign has neglected a vital bit of information regarding what type of fuel your engine is built for. You can fill your car with E10, regular 91, premium 98 or diesel and you will get different results in energy output, mileage and environmental impact, especially if you pump diesel into an unleaded engine. I wonder if we could take heed of this in our own energy consuming lives?

The fact is, humans were not built for high levels of processed sugar or trans-fats with little micronutrients. So, our engines will run extremely poorly when fed these. Give our species another 100,000 years and we may have evolved into candy bar consuming machines, but in the 21st century we are simply dicing with death. If you want your premium engine to run efficiently and effectively for long-time, fuel it with the good stuff. Vegetables, fruits, lean meats and good fats. We aren’t just trying to be party poopers, the science is in, common sense is in, follow it and feel the benefits now and in the future.

### 1. Double Up on Shakes

Let’s say you have a gathering tonight and you know that you will indulge, so you decide to skip a meal to make up for it. Don’t do it, but instead, have a [lean shake](/products/lean-shake-plus-meal-replacement) for breakfast and lunch to balance your blood sugar levels to avoid being so hungry that you overeat and consume too many calories. Having a [high protein shake](/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder) with a handful of spinach, some flax seeds and a couple of blueberries will nourish you and ensure you do not go into feast mode when you eat.

Drinking two protein shakes a day is a great way to make sure that you’re getting enough protein without having to eat too much food. Most people don’t realize how delicious shakes can be! They’re packed with healthy fats, fiber and nutrients that will keep you feeling full for hours. If you find yourself craving sweets or junk food after dinner, this is a great way to satisfy those cravings without going overboard on calories. Double up on shakes and you won’t have room in your stomach for anything else!

### The meat and nuts breakfast

Yep, you heard right. Meat and nuts for breakfast.

Introducing meat and nuts can be the best single dietary tip for promoting optimal leanness, energy and sustained mental focus throughout the day.

---

*"The meat allows for a slow and steady rise in blood sugar. The nuts provide a great source of healthy smart fats that allows the blood sugar to remain stable for an extended period of time." (Charles R. Poliquin)*

---

As we know breakfast is the most important meal of the day. We are often too busy to eat a sit-down breakfast so some initial prep at the start of the week preparing the meat can save precious time.

Take the benefits of this new breakfast all throughout your day – Multiple studies on employee productivity have demonstrated that a high protein breakfast does not only impact on the energy and productivity levels of morning till noon, but extended its positive way in the late afternoon.

### Sample 4-day Meal Plan

| Day            | Menu                               |
|----------------|------------------------------------|
| Breakfast Day 1| 1-3 lean large rissole<br>1 handful of cashew nuts |
| Breakfast Day 2| 1-2 lean turkey burger patties<br>1 handful of almonds |
| Breakfast Day 3| 5 gluten free chicken sausages<br>1 handful of Brazil nuts |
| Breakfast Day 4| Option to mix left over meat into a omelet.<br>Add 2 whole eggs and 2 egg whites plus spinach, capsicum, onions, tomatoes. |

---

### What about if you are allergic to nuts? I then recommend you a portion of the following low glycemic/low fructose fruits with your breakfast:

- apricot
- avocado
- blackberries
- blueberries
- grapefruit
- loganberries
- nectarines
- olives
- papaya
- peach
- plum
- raspberries
- strawberries

---

### On those days where you cannot have the meat and nut breakfast try this awesome on-the-go power smoothie

Ingredients:
- 250mL milk or Almond milk
- 1 banana
- 1 scoop VPA® Protein
- 1 tsp peanut butter
- 2 whole eggs
- Cinnamon ground

Place all the ingredients into a blender and drink straight away. Blending eggs

*Note: The purpose for eating the raw eggs is for the dietary fats in the egg yolk. One small study compared the absorption of protein from both cooked and raw eggs in 5 people. The study found that 90% of protein in cooked eggs was absorbed, but only 50% in raw eggs. In other words, protein in cooked eggs was 80% more digestible.*

### Which is VPA® protein powder is best for me?
Are you asking yourself this question? There are so many different protein powders. Isolate, concentrate, casein, protein blends, weight gainers. Don’t forget vegan friendly and plant based protein powders too! It can be pretty confusing to decide which protein best suits your diet and, more importantly, your goals. To help you out, we have created this easy to reference description of all of our protein powder options to help you decide which protein powder is best for you.

#### Whey Isolate (WPI)

Best for pre/post workout

Whey isolate is a pure whey protein isolate powder. Milk has two proteins which are Whey and Casein. When a coagulant (usually renin) is added to milk, the curds (casein) and whey separate. Whey protein is the water-soluble part of milk. Whey is absorbed faster than other forms of protein, which means it also increases muscle protein synthesis used to break a fasted state. WPI is the highest percentage of protein usually 85%+ and very little carbs, fats and lactose being a very lean source of protein. It’s a great protein to take when watching your weight or generally pre or post workout due to its fast absorption rate when compared to other options.

---

#### Premium Whey (WPC)

Best pre/post workout or anytime

Whey Protein Concentrate. Pretty similar to WPI, except it is slightly less processed leaving it with a little bit more fats, carbs and a slightly less percentage of protein per serve. A tiny bit slower absorption rate than WPI but still absorbs into the system within 30 minutes. If you’re after a slightly cheaper option and not concerned about a very small increase in extra fats and carbs then definitely choose this option for almost any time of day to increase your protein intake.

### Keeping motivated means always having a goal in mind, and what makes this easier is finding someone you admire and find out what gets them going in the morning, how they manage to do what they do – in other words, a Motivational Mentor.

What do you want? Are you keen to bulk for winter, maintain your weight, want to compete in the next crossfit games? Or just be happy in your own skin and maintain your weight while balancing fine food and wine?

---

## Let us start with Goal Setting:

---

- **S** – What is the specific goal? “Lose Weight”
- **M** – How is this goal going to be measured? “I want to lose weight so I fit in a size 10 jean”
- **A** – Is this attainable? “I only need to lose 2 dress sizes” So yes, we got this!
- **R** – Realistic – is this goal realistic? “Yes I can drop 2 sizes”
- **T** – Time frame – Give yourself a time period, so “In 4 months I will fit into my size 10 jean”

---

### Find Your Motivational Mentor:

---

Search the internet, magazines, television shows for people who YOU absolutely feel you would love to be like. Read up on them, follow them on Instagram, Facebook or other social media outlets.

#### What do they do differently to you?

- How can you adjust your lifestyle to be more like this mentor
- What do you need to improve on to be like this mentor?
- What do they eat?
- What do they do in spare time?
- What workouts do they swear by?

---

## Keep a journal/scrapbook/dream board

Take photos, keep photos from the magazines, put recipes up, take a photo of yourself now, find a photo of what your goal is. Put this board somewhere really visible for you (maybe not the kitchen if you are always hosting parties and you are a private person).

**KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE PRIZE!**

The power of the mind is very strong! Visualise yourself talking to your mentor – even better if you can organise a catch up with them!

What do they tell you? Write anything that comes to the mind during this process down. Sometimes some good hard truths will come out using the subconscious technique.

---

Gather your friends and tell them about your goals, they may even want to have some buy-in on this inspirational journey! Having someone else involved to achieve goals is always inspiring – especially if you know your friend is a go-getter, goal achiever, and a motivating person!

Enjoy the Journey and Keep Inspired!

## What is Lean Shake Plus?

If you’re a fan of our [WPI](/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder), [WPC](/products/premium-whey-wpc), or even our [protein blends](/collections/protein-blends) you will know that our goal is to maximise protein per serve, and limit unnecessary ingredients in out products. For this reason customers are sometimes surprised when they look at the ingredient list for our [Lean Shake Plus](/products/lean-shake-plus-meal-replacement), and wonder why it is different to our other shakes. This blog will answer the questions, what is Lean Shake Plus?, what is it used for, and who can use it?

---

Lean Shake Plus is a Formulated Meal Replacement as described by [Food Safety Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ) in Standard 2.9.3](https://www.foodstandards.gov.au/code/Documents/2.9.3%20Supp%20foods%20v157.pdf)

A Formulated Meal Replacement (FMR) must legally meet several criteria, and contain at least:

1. 12g of protein per serve.
2. 850 kilojoules or 203 calories per serve.
3. 25% of the RDI of 16 vitamins and minerals including Vitamin A, Vitamin B6, Iodine, Magnesium and Zinc.

A look at the ingredients of VPA® Lean Shake Plus and you can see that our product contains:

1. 28g protein (because gains are important, and protein keeps you full!).
2. 905 kilojoules or 216 calories.
3. At least 25% RDI of all the required minerals.

Basically, we nailed this product!

---

## Lean Shake Plus can help keep you healthy

FSANZ is strict about the definition of a Meal Replacement, as one serve must provide nutrition equivalent to a food-based meal. Obviously fresh food is the best option, however sometimes a medical condition can prevent someone from eating solid food for a period of time. This is where a FMR can come in handy, providing a drinkable, nutritious meal.

---

## It can help you lose weight

The other purpose of Lean Shake Plus, as indicated by its name, is that it may assist in weight loss. There is nothing in particular about our product, or any other FMR, that is ‘magically’ going to help you lose weight. Instead, it provides you a nutritionally complete, yet low calorie meal. In conjunction with exercise and watching other aspects of your diet, it can help put you into a calorie deficit and help you lose weight.

---

## It is a fast, convenient, on the go snack or meal

Lean Shake isn’t just useful for people trying to lose weight. Yesterday I forgot to bring my lunch to work (again!), but as I am lucky enough to work at VPA®, I was able to crack open a sample sachet of Lean Shake for lunch – one of the many perks of the job! This product may be a convenient option for people who:

- Are on the road a lot and find it difficult to make and take, or purchase healthy food.
- Need a source of quick, easy calories.
- Are disorganized or can’t find the time to meal prep (hi, it’s me!).

---

## It can be used by everyone

Lean Shake isn’t just for mums, men, or people trying to lose weight. It can be used by everyone regardless of their goals. Use it as a meal replacement, a snack, or a convenient meal – the choice is yours.

---

## How is Lean Shake Plus different from other shakes on the market?

All FMRs must conform the FSANZ regulations as described above, and while there will be some differences between brands and products, they will all have the same baseline nutrition. When comparing products consider the following aspects when making your choice.

1. Protein content – 12g is the minimum quantity per serve, however, looking for a product with a higher protein content would be a better option to help keep hunger at bay and maintain muscle mass.
2. Price – VPA® Lean Shake Plus is priced at $31 / kg or $1.82 / serve, while other brands targeting men or mums, charge anywhere between $2.25 – $2.99 per serve at full price.

I’m sure this blog covers everything about Lean Shake Plus that you need to know. If not, hit us up at sales@vpa.com.au with any questions that haven’t been answered here.

### "Use it or lose it" vs muscle memory, what happens to our muscle if we stop resistance training?

Now exercise physiologists do agree that muscle memory is real, but the question is how are these 'muscle memories' stored when our muscles seem to shrink with inactivity?

According to a scientific review published in *Frontiers in Physiology* found that although our muscle cells shrink due to disuse, the nuclei gained during resistance training remains. Meaning that when we are young we are able to store muscle nuclei to prevent fragility in old age, but it also means that steroid use in competitive sport has long term benefits years after the crime was committed.

---

## Our biggest cells in our bodies are in our muscles

"But by far our biggest cells — are our muscles," says Lawrence Schwartz, Professor of Biology at the University of Massachusetts. "Muscle growth is accompanied by the addition of new nuclei from stem cells to help meet the enhanced synthetic demands of larger muscle cells," explains Schwartz. "This led to the assumption that a given nucleus controls a defined volume of cytoplasm — so that when a muscle shrinks or 'atrophies' due to disuse or disease, the number of myonuclei decreases."

---

## A muscle can gain nuclei, but never loses them

New evidence paints a new picture for muscle neclei. "Two independent studies — one in rodents and the other in insects — have demonstrated that nuclei are not lost from atrophying muscle fibers, and even remain after muscle death has been initiated."

This means that when a nucleus has been acquired by a muscle fiber, it belongs to the muscle, most probably for life.

---

## "Use it or lose it — until you use it again"

"It is well documented in the field of exercise physiology that it is far easier to reacquire a certain level of muscle fitness through exercise than it was to achieve it the first place, even if there has been a long intervening period of detraining. In other words, the phrase 'use it or lose it' is might be more accurately articulated as 'use it or lose it, until you work at it again'."

"Anabolic steroids produce a permanent increase in users' capacity for muscle development. In keeping with this, studies show that mice given testosterone acquire new myonuclei that persist long after the steroid use ends." This suggests that drug-free sports should enforce permanent bans for proven steroid cheats, to ensure fair competition.

### So you’ve just worked your ass off for over an hour at the gym, using your new smartwatch to track your calories burned, and as you are driving home you have the thought…”I should re-fuel my body ASAP”. But the danger of being so hungry and overly optimistic because of your endorphins may cause you to make a poor decision and ruin all of your hard work.

**According to a new study from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln**, the time when you decide what you’re going to eat after a workout can dictate what you will eat and potentially undo all of your workout gains. In this study participants had to choose between an apple and brownie, and subjects we found to be more likely to favour the fruit when deciding before vs. after their workouts.

### The researchers of this study said that simply deciding in advance to a post-exercise snack may increase the odds of making healthier food choices.

“We found that there was very little research on this very tangible thing that I think everyone can relate to,” said Koehler, assistant professor in the Department of Nutrition and Health Sciences. “If your goal is to lose weight, then I would say our findings support that you’re better off making the choice … not when you’re hungry after your workout, but instead before you go to the gym.”

This finding supports the research on the correlation between timing and food choice. It has been shown that people are much more likely to indulge when making food choices immediately before eating than when thinking ahead, said Gustafson, assistant professor in the Department of Agricultural Economics.

“Our study conformed very closely to the ideas in behavioral economics about this present-biased preference (for unhealthier options),” Gustafson said.

### But this study also tested two other ideas:

1. Compensatory eating – which suggests that people consume higher calorie food after exercise to compensate for calories burned during a workout.
2. Exercise-induced anorexia – which suggests that exercise actually suppress appetite-related hormones and cause people to eat less.

“There have been a lot of lab studies that have looked at appetite and hunger, most of these studies have found that right after exercise, you seem to be less hungry. I’ve always looked at these studies and wondered: Does it have such a strong impact that you can use this window after you exercise to say, ‘Because I’m not hungry, I’m going to make a really good choice about what I eat’? But knowing myself and many other exercises, there’s also the notion that after you exercise, you want to reward yourself.” Koehler said.

### What did the study discover:

1. Compensatory eating – 6-percent increase in brownie choice between the pre- and post-exercise groups gave some support for the idea of compensatory eating
2. Exercise-induced anorexia – The 12-percent of people that declined a snack in the pre-exercise choice increased to 25 percent at post-exercise.

### But of course these findings create many more questions:

Did the increase in brownie choice come from the immediacy of the decision-making or from the compensatory eating?
What separates people who exhibit compensatory eating vs. exercise-induced anorexia?
What if there were other healthier choices, would people choose better?
But the evidence is clear, make your decision in advance, and you will be much more likely to feed your body the correct nutrition to maximise your workouts. Now, this notion can also be applied to your daily diet, making the decision of what you will eat the night before and preparing that food will dramatically increase your chances of making better eating choices, which have a compounding effect over time, resulting in a healthier, happier life. So if you are training today, make the decision now to pack your VPA® protein shake in your gym bag and get the most out of the hard work you are putting into the gym!

The team reported its findings in the journal *Nutrients*. Koehler and Gustafson authored the study with Nebraska’s Ajai Ammachathram, assistant professor in the Department of Nutrition and Health Sciences; Nigina Rakhmatullaeva, graduate student in agricultural economics; Safiya Beckford, graduate student in nutrition and exercise physiology; and Alexander Cristobal, senior in nutritional science and dietetics.

# Sleep for Weight Loss…really?

With the long hours of work, commuting, family commitments, social activities and household responsibilities it is no wonder we are becoming more and more sleep deprived and living off caffeine. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 35 percent of people are sleep deprived- which is almost identical to the statistic for obesity. Connect the dots and you will see that the connection is no coincidence.

Our body needs 7 or more hours of sleep each night. A study that was published in the Annals of Internal Medicine discovered that those bodies who received adequate rest experienced a 50% reduction in fat loss than the sleep deprived.

## Why Sleep for Weight Loss?

When you are sleep deprived, motivation and energy decreases. Willingness to participate in exercise at your best potential diminishes. Hunger hormones start raging. Insulin metabolism becomes impaired.

## What does this all really mean?

Scientists from Brazil found that lack of good sleep decreases your body’s ability to make muscle, causes muscle loss, and can lead to a higher rate of injury. Muscle increases the body’s metabolism, and if this is jeopardised through lack of sleep, then it is safe to say that sleep deprivation is the enemy of the muscle!

Within 96 hours of sleep deprivation the body’s insulin hormone becomes disrupted – the University of Chicago found that insulin sensitivity decreased by more than 30 percent. Insulin is responsible for removing fat from the bloodstream and prevents it from being stored within the body. When the body becomes insulin resistant, fat starts being stored in the liver and other tissues which can increase the prognosis of diabetes.

Hunger hormones are controlled by leptin and ghrelin. Leptin is produced in fat cells and when you dont have enough, the brain thinks it is still hungry. When you produce more ghrelin you stimulate hunger while also reducing the amount of calories you burn, consequently increasing the amount fat you store. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinoloy and Metabolism found that sleeping less than six hours triggers the area of your brain that increases your need for food while also depressing leptin and stimulating ghrelin.

In Summary, poor sleep equals hormonal disruption which impedes muscle growth and repair, altering hunger hormones and fat storage. So – get napping!

## Suggestions for a good night sleep

- Create a bedtime schedule and try to go to sleep at the same time each day
- Watch what you eat prior bed – soda, tea, coffee and chocolate can stay in your system for up to 5-6 hours which may disrupt sleeping cycles
- Remove technology from the bedroom and keep the lighting dark to minimal – darkness cues the body to release natural sleep hormone melatonin.

### Maximising Your Fat Loss with Heavy vs Light Weight Training

Please note that information and research studies referred to in this blog were found from Jim Stoppani’s [Encyclopedia of Muscle & Strength, 2nd Edition.](https://www.amazon.com/Jim-Stoppanis-Encyclopedia-Muscle-Strength-2nd/dp/1450459749) *Please note that in this blog we are not even touching upon nutrition, this is purely based on training.*

---

### Volume training to Maximise Your Fat Loss

The more sets you do the more calories you burn. Minimum of 20 sets per workout and maximum of 30 sets is a good number to aim for.

---

### Repetition Speed

Research has shown that doing reps fast in an explosive manner can burn more calories both during the workout and after your workout while you rest. Burn 11% more calories when using a 1 count for the concentric phase (positive part) of the exercise and a 2 count for the eccentric phase (lowering part).

It is not a good idea to do ALL exercises in an explosive manner. Choose a few exercises to make explosive and leave some slower.

---

### Rest

One of the most critical variables for maximising fat loss is your rest periods between sets. Generally speaking the less you rest, the more calories you burn.

Cutting rest from 3 minutes to just 30 seconds can more than double the calories you burn in that workout. Also leads to a bigger increase in metabolic rate boost that follows the workout.

---

### Weight Training Techniques for fat loss

Forced reps with help from a partner helps you go past failure rate and has shown to lead to a higher increase in growth hormone levels rather than just taking the set to failure.

Supersets enhance calorie burning and therefore fat loss. A study found that super setting opposing muscles such as chest and back lead to a 35% increase in calories burned compared to the same workout without supersets included.

---

### Training frequency

How much you train impacts on how much fat you lose. The more you train, the more calories you burn therefore the more fat you lose. Another reason more frequent workouts leads to greater fat loss is that when you train muscle groups more frequently, you need to train more muscle groups per workout. This means that you have more muscle tissue that is recovering after the workout is over. After workouts your body is in a state known as oxygen debt. That means it needs more oxygen to burn more fuel (calories) to recover from the workout. With more muscle fibres needed to recover, the calorie burn stays higher for longer.

---

### Summary to maximise fat loss using weight training

The way in which you design your training program can significantly affect fat loss. Incorporate compound free weight exercises, explosive and baliistic training exercises, use heavy and light weights, vary repetition ranges according to the weight used, keep rest periods short, use supersets and forced reps, train muscles more frequently.

You obviously can’t employ these in every workout so spread them out as best you can and swap techniques every 3-4 weeks.

### The best predictor of weight-loss success is diet self-monitoring

The best predictor of weight-loss success is diet self-monitoring. Unfortunately, this practice is viewed as time-consuming so many people do not adopt it, but new research reveals that it only takes 14.6 minutes per day on average. Interestingly thou, it was the frequency of monitoring and not the time spent on monitoring the diet was the key factor for successful weight loss.

---

### “Write it when you bite it”

---

New research to be published in the March issue of *Obesity reveals that* successful participants in an online behavioural weight-loss program spent only 14.6 minutes per day on dietary monitoring. The participants recorded the calories, fat, portion sizes and preparation methods for all food consumed.

“People hate it; they think it’s onerous and awful, but the question we had was: How much time does dietary self-monitoring really take?” said Jean Harvey, chair of the Nutrition and Food Sciences Department at the University of Vermont and the lead author of this study. “The answer is, not very much.”

For 24 weeks, Harvey and her colleagues analysed the self-monitoring of 142 participants. The participants who lost the most weight in the study, spent an average of 23.2 minutes per day on self-monitoring in the first month of the program. By the sixth month, the time had dropped to 14.6 minutes. But what was more predictive of successful weight loss was the frequency of log ins, and not the amount of time spent monitoring.

“Those who self-monitored three or more time per day, and were consistent day after day, were the most successful,” Harvey said. “It seems to be the act of self-monitoring itself that makes the difference — not the time spent or the details included.”

With online dietary monitoring apps like My Fitness Pal, Harvey hopes that this study will motivate more people to use dietary self-monitoring as a weight-loss strategy.

### A Sauna Session vs. Moderate Exercise

A new study conducted by researchers at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (MLU) and the Medical Center Berlin (MCB) have found that the increase in heart rate and blood pressure during a sauna is comparable to that of a moderate workout.

On separate days participants were sent to a sauna and placed on a bicycle ergometer. Both blood pressure levels, and heart rate was measured both during the sauna visit and during exercise, and a rise in both during both conditions were found. The study was recently published in the international journal *Complementary Therapies in Medicine*. 19 volunteers were recruited to measure the immediate effects of sauna use on the cardiovascular system: The participants were exposed to a 25-minute sauna session, while having their blood pressure and heart rate measured. Both rose immediately during the sauna visit. After the sauna session, both blood pressure and heart rate began to drop below participant’s baseline levels that were measured before the sauna session.

In the second part of the study, the participants completed a short exercise program on an exercise bike while also having their blood pressure and heart rate assessed. “Comparing the two conditions, the participants’ blood pressure and heart rate reached the same levels during the sauna session as they did with a load of about 100 watts during the exercise test,” says Ketelhut.

The observations made by the researchers are supported by previous studies that focused primarily on the long-term effects of sauna use, demonstrating positive effects on the cardiovascular system, for example. “A sauna session is a physical strain. Its long-term positive effects are similar to sports activities,” explains Ketelhut. Nevertheless, the healthy sweating does not contribute to weight loss: “The effect is too low as there is no muscle activity. Although we lose weight in the sauna, but these are just the fluids that we sweat out. One should rehydrate after a sauna session, though,” concludes Ketelhut.

### The new word on the block at every gym, bootcamp or fitness class is fascia. So your most likely wondering what the %#*% is fascia?

Fascia is fibrous collagenous tissue, which are part of a body wide tensional force system. In simple terminology fascia is a fibrous net of connective tissue, which surrounds every cell in the body and is heavily interconnected with muscular function. If you removed everything out of the body apart from the fascia you would be able to see an outline of the entire body. Fascia is a mammoth matrix that runs from the tips of the toes to the top of the head and is involved in nearly every organ and structure in between.

---

### So why is it important?

---

Fascia gives the body structure!

It is responsible for:

- Maintaining structural integrity
- Providing support and protection
- Acting as a shock absorber
- Playing a role in hemodynamic and biochemical processes
- Permitting intercellular communication
- Functioning as the body’s first line of defence against infections and pathogenic agents
- Creating an environment for tissue repair post-injury

---

### So why is foam rolling interrelated with fascia?

---

Foam rolling or distinctively named self-myofascial release is the term for self-massage to release muscle tightness or trigger points. In general, self-myofascial release is intended to address localised tightness in the fascia.

Benefits of self-myofascial release:

- Improves joint range of motion and flexibility
- Reduces muscle soreness and recovery from training
- Reduces arterial stiffness
- Improves performance

---

### What are myofascial trigger points?

---

Myofascial trigger points are defined as tender spots in discrete taut bands of hardened muscle that produce local and referred pain. This mean that a trigger point is an area that when compressed produces pain. There are many causes of trigger points some of these include:

- Muscle overuse
- Muscle strains
- Inflammation
- Stress
- Prolonged immobility
- Direct trauma
- Hormonal imbalance
- Nutritional imbalance
- Poor posture

### So how long does it take for the myofascial release?

---

It takes approximately 90 seconds for the fascial network to response to slow gentle pressure applied to it and between 3 to 5 minutes for the release of fascia. If the release is too short the trigger point may be activated and if too long, bruising may occur.

---

### How often should foam rolling be incorporated into workouts?

---

There is no sufficient answer here. This all depends on the body, whether there is acute tightness, persistent muscle tightness etc. A suggested frequency of 2-3 times per week is adequate in most cases.

If you are experiencing muscle tightness persistently please consult with your health care provider.

### The great Mike Tyson once said, “Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.” Well, I’m going to reframe Mike’s words of wisdom for the fitness scene. “Anyone who asks for a plan needs a slap in the face.” Well, sort of…

I sit with many potential clients on a weekly basis and without a doubt, one of the most accurate ways to determine whether someone is going to fail to get results with their health and fitness is if the following phrase gets uttered. “If I could just get you to write me a plan and I will give it a go myself.” On the surface this seems like a very innocent and in many respects a smart way to attack your forth-coming health journey, but unfortunately, it is a loaded request. Loaded with what you ask?

This request is loaded full of tepid commitment. It is the calling card of the soon-to-be ‘non-active’ gym member. It is an illusory action that lulls all into a false sense of security. See everyone loves a good plan, myself included and to be without a plan is to be walking blind. However, of all the plans I have written for people over the years, you can be sure 99% of them lie in the digital or physical trash can. Not because they were useless but because the recipient was only wanting it to make themselves feel like they were doing ‘something’.

Don’t get me wrong, behind most great achievements was a well-laid plan, whether it be Arnie’s assault on the Olympia or the battle on the beaches of Normandy. But many a great plan lies in waste because of an equally great lack of action. Yet, most are flabbergasted that their plans fail when in fact the plan was completely fine, it was the execution that stunk. So, I’m here to un-stink it for you…

---

### Steps to Un-stink your plan:

1. Discover where you are now. It is hard to find where you are going when you (or google maps) has no idea what your current location is. If you don’t know, ask someone who you think might be able to tell you i.e. a trainer.
2. Know where you want to go. As with part one, having a destination stops us from just wandering around in the wilderness hoping the plans will make us happy.
3. Attach yourself to some motivating or inspiring WHY. We are motivated to go to the grocery store because if we don’t we won’t have deodorant to stop the body odour or detergent to clean our clothes. If we need a WHY for basic hygiene, we need one to improve our health.
4. Prioritize your goals. If you have set a goal but it remains as an add-on to your life then be prepared to watch it slip through your fingers. What gets prioritized gets done.
5. Get organized. Do you or your calendar know what you are doing on Friday at 6:30pm? Do you know what you are having for lunch in 2 days’ time? Well, if you don’t want your lovely plans to go up in flames, you better start knowing.
6. Get out the measuring tape. If what gets prioritized gets done, then what gets measured gets double-done. There’s nothing like a good kick in the pants from a comparison of where you should be versus where you are now.

There it is. Who would have guessed that there was more to life and health than just a plan? But that was just the easy part. Good luck with the execution.

## VPA® is excited to introduce Cluster Dextrin to our product range.

Cluster Dextrin is a new and more advanced carbohydrate fuel that could improve the way you fuel your training. It is the ideal pre- or intra- workout fuel to add to your supplement stack.

## What is Cluster Dextrin?

Also known as Highly Branched Cyclic Dextrin, Cluster Dextrin, is a more rapidly digested and absorbed carbohydrate. What sets Cluster Dextrin apart from other carbohydrate powders on the market is its chemical structure. Like maltodextrin, Cluster Dextrin is derived from corn, but it has a [higher molecular weight, lower osmotic pressure and higher solubility.](https://www.glico.com/nutrition/en/product/finechemical/cdextrin/) Because of these properties, Cluster Dextrin passes through the stomach more rapidly than other carbohydrate drinks. This means a reduced feeling of fullness and a faster yet more sustained release of energy. This translates to improved athletic performance.

---

## What are the benefits of Cluster Dextrin?

- Compared to other carbohydrate sources, Cluster Dextrin:
  1. **Demonstrates faster gastric emptying times**

One of the key issues that endurance athletes face is the ability to stomach food and liquid during training and events. Gastric discomfort can not only impede performance directly but can also limit the amount of fuel an athlete can take on. The [faster gastric emptying times](https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-2004-820999) demonstrated by Cluster Dextrin may not only [reduce discomfort](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/fstr/10/4/10_4_428/_article/-char/ja/), but could enable an athlete to take on more fuel per hour than they were previously able to.

- **Enhances endurance performance**

It makes logical sense that a decrease in gastric emptying times, and more sustained release of energy demonstrated by Cluster Dextrin is likely to lead to better athletic performance, and this is supported by research. Consuming Cluster Dextrin has been shown to lead to an [increased time to exhaustion](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282511164_Evaluation_of_Exercise_Performance_with_the_Intake_of_Highly_Branched_Cyclic_Dextrin_in_Athletes) in elite swimmers when compared to a placebo (water) and glucose. It has also been linked to a [decrease in rate of perceived exertion](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09168451.2014.943654) compared to other carbohydrates.

---

## Who should use Cluster Dextrin?

Cluster Dextrin is an ideal fuel for endurance athletes, both before and during exercise. However, it can also benefit those participating in other types of training. If you like to take an energy drink, sports drink, or any other carbohydrate source before training then you could benefit from taking Cluster Dextrin. Cluster Dextrin can be used in place of any pre-workout meal particularly if you are heading into a session knowing you haven’t eaten at all, or haven’t eaten enough.

---

## When and how to take Cluster Dextrin

VPA® Cluster Dextrin comes in a 260g bottle, containing 14, 20g serves. It also comes in two varieties, unflavoured and watermelon flavoured. The unflavoured version is ideal for people who might want to combine Cluster Dextrin with other products like a pre-workout or electrolytes.

---

## When to take Cluster Dextrin

Taking 20g around 30 minutes before commencing exercise is ideal, however you can increase this to 30g if you feel it is necessary to fuel the training you are about to do.

During prolonged endurance exercise, consuming 30-90g of VPA® Cluster Dextrin per hour is ideal. While other carbohydrate sources may limit the amount of fuel you can take on in an hour due to gastric discomfort, cluster dextrin, in having a rapid gastric emptying time, may mean you can take on more fuel than ever before.

So there you have it, everything you need to know about the best fuel source available. We’d love to hear what you think about Cluster Dextrin once you give it a go.

## Protein Requirements and Supplements

### How much protein do I need?

Protein; by now we all know why we need it. Protein, is not only essential for building muscle but also has a vital role in forming other physical structures such as connective tissue, and blood vessels. It addition, protein is essential to creating hormones and enzymes that are vital to essential physiological processes in our bodies. OK, so we know we need it, but that leads to the next question; just exactly how much protein is needed to stay healthy and perform at your sporting best?

### What are my protein requirements?

Like most nutrition questions, the answer to this is “It depends”.
The amount of protein you need is dependent on a variety of factors including:
- Your age
- Your health status
- How active you are
- What sports you do
- What your goals are

Protein needs are usually given as how many grams of protein you need to eat, per kilogram of body weight each day.
For example: The protein requirements of someone during general training is given as 1g/kg of body weight. This means, a female who weighs 60kg will need 60g of protein per, while a male who weighs 90kg needs 90g of protein per day.

**Check out the table below to see the protein requirements of different groups of people:**

![Protein Requirements](https://i.shgcdn.com/cc9d8d48-e870-4aca-af87-f4cb2fd2fe80/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

### Do I need to use a protein supplement?

It’s entirely possible to hit your daily protein requirements using food alone. However, here are some reasons supplementing with protein may be beneficial and help you reach your daily protein goals:

#### High protein targets can be hard to hit

Whether you have large protein requirements because you’re a heavy strength training man, or you’re requirements aren’t that high but you find it difficult to plan your food to hit your targets, a protein shake may help get you there.

#### Whey protein stimulates muscle synthesis

Due to its high leucine content, whey protein consistently outperforms other protein sources when it comes to stimulating muscle synthesis for repair and growth.

#### It's convenient

With the convenience and portability of a protein shake, there are literally no excuses for not being able to hit daily protein targets.

**SEO Description:** Citrulline is an amino acid that can reduce muscle pain and soreness that you experience while training. It is a great addition to your supplement regimen.

### What is citrulline malate?

Citrulline malate is a supplement used to increase strength and endurance. The main benefit of citrulline malate is an increase in nitric oxide levels, which can improve blood flow to muscles. How does it benefit powerlifters?

---

Citrulline malate contains L-citrulline bonded with malic acid.

L-Citrulline is an amino acid which gets converted by the body into [L-arginine](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/aakg?_pos=3&_sid=fd7d5935f&_ss=r). Arginine is converted into nitric oxide. Nitric oxide promotes the relaxation and opening of blood vessels which increases blood and oxygen flow through the body.

Citrulline malate enhances creatine phosphate regeneration – meaning quicker recovery between sets. Research doesn’t appear to support that this happens for L-citrulline alone, so this aspect is attributed to the malic acid.

The reason why citrulline malate is used instead of arginine supplementation is that it actually raises blood arginine levels more effectively than arginine supplementation since arginine is more poorly absorbed. Taking high enough dosages of arginine to reach appropriate levels is possible, but often leads to GI distress.

---

### Benefits of citrulline malate?

Citrulline Malate [increases blood levels of ornithine and arginine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17953788?dopt=Abstract) and improves nitric oxide metabolism and the ammonia recycling process.

This increases [lactate](https://www.medigraphic.com/cgi-bin/new/resumenI.cgi?IDARTICULO=36827) and [ammonia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28664349) clearance following exercise. For lifters, this appears to have a carryover effect for people doing multiple sets of an exercise. While the first set might only have a mild improvement, if any at all, the later sets might show a much more noticeable improvement.

This ammonia-buffering effect reduces acidosis during exercise and also helps [reduce delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMs) noticeably](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7440292?dopt=Abstract).

Citrulline Malate also [improves ATP production following exercise](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12145119?dopt=Abstract), which is another aspect as to why it might help more as sets progress. Malic acid is an intermediate in the citric acid cycle, which is how it is theorised to help with this process.

The main implications of supplementation appear to be the ability to [add an extra couple of reps](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26658899) here and there while resistance training. There potentially could be benefits for supplementing citrulline malate for endurance performance, but there isn’t a lot of research to support that view at this stage.

---

It’s also unclear whether adding [citrulline malate into other supplements provides an additive effect](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23281794?dopt=Abstract). [Caffeine](https://idealnutrition.com.au/the-low-down-on-caffeine-and-sports-performance/), [creatine](https://idealnutrition.com.au/creatine/), and [beta-alanine](https://idealnutrition.com.au/?s=beta+alanine) supplementation each individually could provide benefits for lifters.

---

### Does citrulline malate work?

It has been interesting watching the research evolve over the years. Up until 2016, the research was mostly promising for citrulline malate. Since then there have been some studies showing mixed results.

I’m sure you’ve heard the saying “If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail” by Benjamin Franklin before. In relation to eating well, and hitting nutrition and diet goals, this pearl of wisdom is particularly relevant. Today our lives are so jam packed with different commitments that eating well can take a back seat, becoming an afterthought. Meals become something we fit in whenever we can, in any way we can. However, it doesn’t have to be that way. There are many ways you can plan your nutrition for the week ahead. While batch cooking 28 identical meals, in 28 containers to store in your fridge for the week ahead, might work for some, it’s not for everyone. Meal prepping in that way doesn’t really work if you’ve got to fit food for 4 other people in the fridge as well, you like more variety in your food, or you want to eat the same meals as your family. So with this in mind, here are things you can do on the weekend, to help you succeed with your nutrition for the week ahead.

### Do a weekly meal plan
Plan your meals for the week ahead, write a list of what meal you are going to eat on what evening and stick to it. Take into account evenings where you don’t have a lot of time to cook because you have something on and plan quick meals for those evenings. Writing a meal plan and shopping list, then sticking to it, will also reduce your grocery bill!

### Cut your vegetables on the weekend
One of the barriers to eating vegetables is our laziness! Cutting vegetables ahead of time means not only are you more likely to eat them as a snack, but it will also reduce your nightly cooking time. Do you need an example? On Wednesdays I finish work and then take two of my children to activities, not arriving home until around 7pm. One of my go-to meals on this night is fajitas. To prepare, on Sunday I slice the chicken and cover it in spice, then cut up a huge batch of red onion, capsicum, and zucchini. I store these in containers in the fridge so that on Wednesday evening, all I need to do is heat up the wok and throw it all in to cook. Dinner is usually done within 10 minutes.

### Cook enough for two meals
You may not have enough room in your fridge for a weeks’ worth of meals, but you can fit in leftovers! This means that instead of cooking 7 nights a week, you could cook every second night instead if you wanted, or at least not cook on nights when you know you are going to be busy. Ideal meals for this could be spaghetti bolognese or stir fry – just cook fresh rice or pasta.

If you are a person who likes meal prepping your own meals, we can help you out with that as well!

We’re talking about the chilling facts about poor sleep and not getting enough of it. During bedtime, our body and brain go to work, essentially doing a critical reboot process which is why it’s so important to get a full night’s rest (which is 7 to 9 hours for most adults).

Not sleeping enough can lead to an array of health problems like depression, psychological distress, weight gain, increase risk for diabetes and heart risk, food cravings, weakened immune system and can even affect your athletic performance at the gym.

There are several supplements that are worth considering to improve your sleep quality:

If your goal is to lose weight, lose fat, shred, or achieve a more toned body then you have probably googled- "Best supplements for losing weight.” The world of weight loss supplements can be overwhelming, so we are here to help find the best one for you.

To lose weight, one must have a calorie deficit. But is a high protein intake necessary? “Is protein one of the secrets to weight loss?”, was a question that an Accredited Practising Dietitian and Accredited Sports Dietitian, Aidan Muir, answered and discussed in a blog a while back. The research is clear that protein is the most satiating of all the macronutrients. If you eat 1500 calories per day and have 30% of your calories coming from protein you will likely feel fuller and reduce your appetite. A high protein intake also boosts metabolism and changes several weight-regulating hormones.

### 1. WPI or WPC

Our protein powders are one of our best-selling products for reasons being, they are guaranteed of highest quality, pure Australian NZ whey protein. Supplementing with a good quality protein powder is a great way to do it. It isn’t necessarily better than reaching the same protein target through food, but there are times when it is far more convenient since it requires zero prep time and you can also easily take it on the go.

### What is Whey Protein Isolate?

Whey Protein Isolate or WPI is a very fast-digesting dairy protein that consists of at least 90% protein, with almost no carbohydrates or fats. WPI is also 99% lactose-free, making it suitable for most people who are lactose intolerant.

### What is Whey Protein Concentrate?

Whey Protein Concentrate or WPC is a slower-digesting protein that contains lots of macronutrients and bioactive compounds. WPC is a great option to consume throughout the day.

[What’s the difference between WPI and WPC?](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/supplements/wpi-vs-wpc-what-s-the-difference) We’ve that covered on a different blog to help you choose which one is right for you. One thing you’ll love with our protein powders are the amazing range in flavours! No more boring limited options. And if you’re keen on having a taste of ALL of them, we recommend grabbing a [sample pack](https://www.vpa.com.au/pages/search-results-page?q=sample+pack) to try them out before making the big leap.

## Mental health benefits from exercise

We all know exercise has numerous benefits for our physical health. There are plenty of literature and tips on physique, muscle, and strength building, as well as how it could even add years to your life. While these are great motivators for exercise, most fitness enthusiasts, and athletes also benefit from a sound [mental health](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10739267/) and great sense of well-being.

In the brain, exercise stimulates chemicals that can boost your mood, improve sleep, and can alleviate many common mental health problems like depression, anxiety, and stress. You may be surprised how a simple lifestyle change from most of today’s usual sedentary routines can help you feel “unstuck.”

## How much physical activity or exercise should I be doing?

Physical activity is anything that gets the body moving. If you’re more or less sedentary throughout the day at work, you can be mindful about making small choices like opting to use the stairs instead of the elevator or simply making time for a quick workout to start or end your day. The key take way is that some physical activity is better than none.

According to the World Health Organization, Adults aged 18–64 should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week or do at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity.

There are multiple ways for accumulating at least 150 minutes of physical activity outside of the gym per week with simple activities like walking, gardening, household chores, hiking, cycling, and various sports.

Our team got around to interview a couple of our VPA athletes who were eager to share their story on how they overcame the personal battles they were going through. In a sea of amazing physical transformation stories, we found that highlighting how overcoming adversity and issues especially mental health related, through exercise seemed so refreshing. In fact, it is something we ought to see more of.

**SEO Title:** Leucine – The King of the Aminos

**SEO Description:** L-Leucine is one of the three branch chain amino acids, and of all the amino acids it plays the most important role in stimulating muscle protein synthesis. Continue reading to find out how and why this happens.

## Excerpt

## L-Leucine: The Key to Muscle Protein Synthesis

L-Leucine is one of the three branch chain amino acids, and of all the amino acids it plays the most important role in stimulating muscle protein synthesis. Continue reading to find out how and why this happens.

---

## Content

---

Consuming protein after exercise is important for two reasons. Firstly, protein provides the amino acid building blocks with which muscles and connective tissues are repaired and built. Secondly, the ingestion of amino acids provides the stimulus that tells your body it’s time to start muscle protein synthesis. In relation to providing this stimulus, not all proteins and amino acids are created equal. [L-Leucine](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/leucine) is one of the three branch chain aminos, and of all the amino acids it plays the most important role in stimulating muscle protein synthesis. Continue reading to find out how and why this happens.

---

### What is an essential amino acid?

Amino acids are the building blocks of protein. There are 20 amino acids, and they form chains of various combinations and lengths to make different proteins. Of the 20 amino acids, 9 are essential amino acids. Essential amino acids can’t be made within our body, and the only way to obtain them is through food. They are found in the greatest amounts in animal proteins including dairy, beef, fish and eggs.

---

### What are branched chain amino acids?

Of the 9 essential amino acids, three have a branched chain structure and are known as branched chain amino acids (BCAAs). Unlike other amino acids, BCAAs are broken down in muscle tissue rather than the liver, and from this they are more readily available to be used for muscle repair and synthesis. The three BCAA are leucine, isoleucine and valine.

---

### Why is leucine important?

Of all the amino acids, L-Leucine is the [most important in triggering Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS)](https://www.mysportscience.com/post/2017/10/18/how-much-protein-do-i-need-to-eat-to-build-muscle), with the consumption of leucine acting as a switch to turn on MPS by activating the [mTOR pathway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTORC1). Other than in human muscle tissue which contains very high levels, Leucine is found in highest concentrations in dairy products including whey and casein proteins. For those who are unable for health or ethical reasons to consume dairy products leucine supplementation is very important.

The consumption of 3g of Leucine post training is needed to trigger MPS. A 20g serve of [whey protein](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder) or [casein](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/micellar-casein) contains around 3g of leucine. Plant proteins contain lower concentrations of leucine so you may need a 30-40g of plant protein isolate to obtain the same amount of leucine. Alternatively you may want to look for a plant protein with added leucine such as [VPA Premium Plant](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/premium-plant-vegan-protein).

Alternatively, leucine can be supplemented in powder form to ensure you are obtaining the optimal intake post training to stimulate MPS. You can find [VPA L-Leucine powder here](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/leucine).

Explore our [range of Amino Acids](https://www.vpa.com.au/collections/amino-acids).

---

Hopefully, this blog has explained why your choice of post workout meal and protein supplement is vital to promoting your optimal recovery and muscle growth. After all, leucine is king and you need to ensure you are getting enough of it.

---

## Beet 500

---

### What is Beet 500?

BEET 500 is a pure and natural beetroot powder and nitrate supplement. It is made from freeze-dried concentrated beetroot juice. Beetroots, beetroot juice, and beetroot powder are natural sources of nitrate, and nitrate is a sports performance enhancing compound. The evidence that beetroot improves sports performance is so strong that the Australian Institute of sport have classed it as a Group A supplement, meaning that it works!

### What does beetroot powder do?

Beetroot powder is a natural but potent source of nitrate. When consumed, our bodies convert nitrate into nitric oxide. Nitric oxide has many important roles within the body, but its benefit to sports performance comes from its ability to dilate and expand our blood vessels, allowing more blood to be delivered to our muscles. This increased blood flow carries more oxygen to our muscles, allowing you to work harder. Nitrate also reduces the energy cost of exercise and helps muscle contraction.

---

## Sports gels

---

When we exercise our body uses two sources of fuel to feed our muscles – fat and carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are used as the main fuel source – and are relied on more for high-intensity exercise. We store carbohydrates as glycogen in the muscles. As we exercise, muscle glycogen levels begin to fall. If these stores are not replenished performance can be affected. Sports gels can also contain other ingredients like electrolytes such as sodium to replace minerals lost through sweat. Some also contain caffeine.

### Performance Gels

VPA® Performance Gels use two types of carbohydrates. They contain fast-acting fructose to give you a quick acting energy boost. They also contain maltodextrin which is a slower acting energy source. Using two types of carbohydrates means that your muscles will get a steady stream of energy.

### Magnegel

Magnesium is critical for nerve and muscle function and is essential for maintaining bone health. A magnesium deficiency may result in muscle spasms, nerve twitches, cramping, and fatigue. VPA® magnegel contains added magnesium to promote energy and recovery. Magnegel assists with maintaining adequate mineral concentrations during exercise to promote optimal performance. After exercise, Magnegel provides nutrients that positively affect energy production and recovery.

## Creatine

Creatine increases the rate at which energy can be produced and used within our body. Creatine helps you work harder and work longer by helping to replenish our energy systems. This increases peak power output, and this in turn has several positive imp...

# The Mind-Muscle Connection

The mind-muscle connection has been a bodybuilding theory for decades and today we are seeing more and more research to validate the technique. What are the benefits of the mind-muscle connection for muscle and strength?

---

## Content

### What is mind-muscle connection?

When it comes to physical fitness, you would be surprised as to how much the mind contributes to successful results during training. Most professional athletes and body builders know the importance of implementing a ["mind-muscle connection."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26700744/) It has been a bodybuilding theory for decades and today we are seeing more and more research to validate the technique.

---

### How does mind-muscle connection work?

As with anything there is in life, you need to have the right mindset to make the most out of whatever it is you’re doing. We have all experienced an off day at the gym. When you’re stressed, have too much on your mind, and are not feeling the workout, your performance won’t be as good either.

The idea behind the mind-muscle connection is simple – when one consciously focuses on moving the targeted muscle during exercise, the [quality of the contraction is enhanced.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26700744/) By using concentrated, internal focus during each rep makes the muscle work as hard as possible.

---

### What are the benefits of practicing better mind-muscle connection?

By training consciously and improving your mind-muscle connection, you will begin to notice its benefits such as:

- Improved muscle coordination
- Improved self-awareness and control
- Compensation for asymmetries
- Better hyper-irradiation
- Better results

---

### Tips on how to create a better mind-muscle connection for Muscle & Strength

1. Move Slowly
   Firstly, be mindful of your form and we cannot stress this enough so as not to risk any injuries. When doing a movement, move slowly and it helps to pause to achieve peak contraction. Rushing on the reps won’t do you any good. The more time your muscles are under tension, the more they have to work and the more time you have to mentally connect to the muscle movement.

2. Tempo and tension
   When you’re building muscles, tension is your best friend. You’ll want that muscle activated and under stress to see results.
   A good workout formula to achieve tension would be:
   - **FAST**: Perform the movement relatively quickly.
   - **HOLD**: Squeeze and hold at the climax of the movement.
   - **SLOW**: Resist and perform a slow movement back to feel the muscle fibers stretching.
   - **REPEAT!

3. Flex your muscle targets in between sets
   Yup, flexing is part of the process and be proud of your gains! The mirrors are there for a reason. Take a few seconds between sets to flex the muscles you’ve been working on. Conscious posing between sets helps not to break that momentum.

4. SUPPLEMENTATION WITH PRE-WORKOUTS
   Any supplement containing ingredients that improve cognition (focus, memory, alertness) will help you stay in focus while training. Most of these are found in pre-workouts. They not only help boost your focus but also endurance and strength. VPA® has a great range of [pre-workouts](https://www.vpa.com.au/collections/pre-intra-supplements). Check out our pre and intra-workout supplements today.

## The Burden of Chronic Stress

The never-ending burden of chronic stress can be created by life. It is highly important that we are able to manage stress as this can lead to reduced fitness, depression, and can inevitably kill us. Here are some techniques for stress management.

---

## Content

## The never-ending burden of chronic stress

The never-ending burden of chronic stress can be created by life. As this occurs, the body continuously releases dopamine, norepinephrine, and cortisol stress hormones. If this is not controlled, constant stress can lead to reduced fitness, depression, and can inevitably kill us.

## Stress will manifest by raising the risk/s of:

- Obesity / Increase of Weight
- Insulin Resistance / Diabetes Type II
- Hypertension
- Hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol)
- Cardiovascular Disease
- Persistent Fatigue
- Anxiety disorders and depression
- Eating disorders (both overeating and undereating)
- Abuse of drugs & liquor (including smoking).

## The resistance to stress

The resistance to stress has a huge effect on your ability to retain the quality of your life. If you cannot handle tension, a high-quality of life cannot be appreciated. The ability to select behaviors where you can affect the challenging situation by keeping composure and maintaining balance is one of the most critical reasons for doing this.

Many individuals may not know that there is a clear association between stress regulation and modulation of desires. When you manage your emotions, you decrease the possible risk triggers. Stress management will also lead to your plans for weight loss, as well as your overall wellbeing and well-being.

## Some Techniques for Stress Control include:

- Meditation
- Positive visualization
- Embracing favorable self-talk
- Breathe Regulated (Breathing)
- Exercising
- Relaxing
- Take your occasional time off. Introduction more holidays
- Grab an interesting hobby
- Get yourself a shot of humor (NOT with food, narcotics, or alcohol!) Diversion
- Providing a network of encouragement to express thoughts & feelings

Speak to a psychologist 1 on 1 (therapy appointments are NOT only about mental illness, but also for mental wellbeing that can deteriorate from heavy levels of stress).

Ensure that you pay as much attention to stress control as to your targets for weight loss, diet, wellness, and fitness, as the relationship between them all is more important than you would imagine!

# Protein Water: A New Trend in Fitness

For athletes and fitness enthusiasts, the importance of protein in one’s diet is apparent and valued. It plays an important role as it helps repair and strengthens the muscles. Hence, the increase in demand for whey protein shakes and workout supplements. But here is something relatively new to some; Protein Water.

You get a source of protein in clear, water form. It is not creamy and milky and comes in different flavors (depending on the kind of brands). It’s like an upgraded energy drink, packed with more nutrients that your body will need to optimize its peak performance. It replenishes your body with protein, amino acids, and electrolytes.

So how did this “Protein Water” make it to the list of our new favorite protein drinks? Is it just a fad? Is it a good protein source to add into our daily protein essentials? Time to dive right into those questions!

### What is protein water?

Protein water is made up of different sources of protein (WPI, collagen, BCAA and L-glutamine) and is combined with water. Ideally, it is high in protein and low in calories. Depending on the brand, some Protein Waters may contain vitamins and minerals such as electrolytes.

### Benefits of protein water

Protein water is a quick and easy way to hydrate and feed your body with muscle-building protein. It is shelf-stable and transportable which makes it a convenient grab and drink protein source. Protein water flows with you, ready to be consumed throughout your day, anytime and anywhere.

### Protein water vs Whey protein powder

Texture. Since protein water is not made purely from dairy, it does not have that milky/creamy texture which some people dislike. You can also find protein powders in different flavors, making it a friendly and refreshing protein source suitable to drink any time.

### Is Protein Water better than Protein Powder?

To conclude, to see which of the two is better will depend on your goals, preferences, and your needs/wants.

If your goal is to build more muscle and boost recovery, then protein powders such as WPI or WPC would still be the perfect choice because they contain the clinical dose of muscle-building protein. Protein powders are also perfect for those who prefer drinking their protein as a shake rather than eating them.

While if you are someone who enjoys protein as a dish and would want to get more sources of high-quality protein in their diet, then protein water is an excellent option for you because it is high in protein and low in calories.

At the end of the day, it all boils down to YOU. Listen to your body. Be it protein water, or protein shake, it will ultimately come down to what you think works best for your body, your health, and what makes you feel better.

## Growing kids and especially active children need to consume an adequate amount of proteins, vitamins and minerals to ensure their body and mind can function optimally during such formative years. While you may be able to add some [protein-rich foods](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/supplements/the-different-protein-typeswhat-are-the-different-types-of-protein-and-what-s-the-difference-find-out-more-by-reading-this-blog) in their diets, doing so can sometimes be a challenge especially when you’ve got a fussy eater.

## Protein shakes for kids are a great way to ensure that your child has their recommended intake of protein along with the necessary vitamins and minerals they need in every meal.

## Parents will be delighted to find that our **Kids Daily Shake** are formulated with a dairy-free option and in classic delicious flavours every child will enjoy – vanilla and chocolate.

## Excerpt

Training the mind to be calm and fit is just as important as strengthening and nurturing the body. Meditation is one of the best ways to optimize our minds, resulting in a better and healthier well-being.

---

## Content

## The mind is one of the most powerful tools we have as humans. It sets our pace, dictates our limits, emotions, how we act and react. It’s the root of our emotions, decisions, and growth.  As I like to describe it, the mind is basically like a clock. It never stops ticking. But to function properly, a clock must be maintained and taken care of by a skilled and trusted horologist, and some good ol’ heavy-duty battery to keep it up and running 24/7. 

Athletes and anyone who's had a hand in any sport would know too how much the mind plays a role in the body and its overall performance. How do we overcome distractions and stress in the playing field? Meditation helps.

### What is Meditation?

At its most elemental, it is just sitting, accepting the moment for how it is and being present. It’s like sitting by the shore, watching the sun set, half-listening to all the sounds of nature, and your thoughts or the sensation of sand on your skin.

![Meditation Image](https://i.shgcdn.com/55e9b482-332d-4566-9578-a716c04ae282/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

Most people relate it with relaxation but bear in mind that in meditating, we are both relaxed and alert at the same time. Releasing our body from all the tension with every breath and allowing it to be alert and have a better chance to hear the surroundings, feelings, sensations, and thoughts. Revealing the “noises” that surround us and learning to be still while acknowledging its existence, opening our minds and embracing the moment and everything that comes with it, learning that it will all pass. 

But how does it benefit athletes?

### Benefits of Meditation for Athletes

#### 1. Enhance Focus

Overcoming high intensity feats like joining a marathon, playing sports, or preparing for a competition is physically hard but training your mind to do the work is even harder. Meditation helps training the mind to zone out and focus on the important task at hand. A great example of achieving results with good focus is our [mind-muscle connection.](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/mind-muscle-connection?_pos=1&_sid=d7afaece4&_ss=r)

---

#### 2. Reduce Stress

Athletes go through tons of major stress mentally aside from physical stress. Meditation helps our bodies relaxed and helps us stay centered and trains our minds to remain calm under pressure. Meditation also helps build our self-confidence as it puts us on a more positive mindset while training.

---

#### 3. Speed up Recovery Time

Quality sleep and recovery time is as much important as the work we put in training. Sometimes people don't see results because they have overworked their bodies and take recovery time for granted. One [study](https://academic.oup.com/sleep?pid=28194) has proven that athletes with poor sleep patterns experienced weight gain, mood disturbance, increased anxiety/depression, inability to maintain focus/concentration, and decreased motor control. Meditation eases the mind and the body and even boosts the immune system and prevent any illnesses that may get in the way of training.

---

### Other Benefits of Meditation:

- Improve emotion regulation: cope with difficult/challenging situations
- Improve conflict resolution skills
- Increased resilience: overcome challenges
- Increased empathy and respect
- Improve overall well-being: feeling healthier and energized
- Heightened expression of creativity and collaboration

To end this blog, I want you to sit comfortably, take a deep breath and slowly exhale. Relax your forehead, unclench your jaw, relax your shoulders and think of your intentions for today. 

Now, notice how nice it feels to make time for yourself? That’s the gift of meditation.

# Fitness Resolutions Tips

It is the New Year once again, time to get our resolutions up and our methods in keeping it sharped. Most of the time we neglect and leave our fitness resolutions unkept. So here's a quick breakdown of 5 simple and effective tips to help you achieve and keep your fitness resolutions.

---

## Content

### It is the New Year once again
It is the time where everybody is highly motivated and inspired to start fresh and become the best versions of themselves.

### Fitness resolutions are always in the mix
Fitness resolutions are always in the mix of our list. And as cliche as it can be, it is also the most neglected and unkept.

---

## Here is a quick breakdown of 5 simple tips that can help you achieve and keep your fitness resolutions.

### 1. SRP Resolution: Short, Realistic, and Precise
Keep your resolutions short, realistic, and precise.

It sure is exciting to write our aspirations but let us not get carried away and list an incredible and drowning amount of goals for the year. Remember that you are only one body and one mind. Keep it short!

Be realistic and precise: acknowledge where your body is at, and respect your starting point. From there, determine the things and activities that your body can handle. It is easier for our mind and body to process a goal when we know what we want to achieve, how to achieve it, and when set in realistic conditions.

Always remember to be kind and patient with your body and start with small steps.

---

### 2. The 21-day Road to Discipline
I highly recommend learning the art of discipline. It is good to have motivation but as we all know, it wears out, and it is the discipline that gets us to do something.

So how does the 21-day road to Discipline go?

Incorporate your SRP resolution/s with this method, schedule it to a 21-day streak plan, and set a reward for reaching the 21 days. Break the streak, start back to zero but reach the 21-day streak, a reward awaits, and a new goal or a healthy habit is achieved.

- Why schedule and plan? When something is properly scheduled, we have a higher possibility of achieving and remembering the task we need to do.
- Why a 21-days streak? It only takes 21 days to build a habit. So try your best not to break it and let your goals grow on you.

---

### 3. Get Support
Get a workout partner, immerse yourself with a good community of fitness enthusiasts, or maybe hire a trainer!

One's fitness journey is never easy. It requires a lot of dedication and effort, and it can more often be stressful physically and emotionally. It would greatly help to have a support system to be there whenever we need that extra push to keep you going.

---

### 4. Enjoy the process and have fun
Choose exercises and programs that you personally like to keep your fitness journey fun and exciting, enjoy meeting the people in the gym, and celebrate your wins, small or big!

Exercising can sometimes feel gruesome already, might as well make it fun! After all, nothing is better than doing something that makes you happy.

---

### 5. Do not give up
Have a mindset of a champion and never give up. When things get challenging and frustrating, remind yourself again why you are doing it and keep going. I swear, it is worth it. So don't quit, keep hustling!

---

So, there you have it. Five simple and effective ways to help you keep your resolutions.

One last reminder, set your goals high but remember to be kind and patient with yourself, stay focused and determined but also learn to enjoy and cherish the process, stay strong and persevere but also know when to rest. Don't aim for a new you, but a better and stronger you.

Cheers to another fruitful year, legends!

## Benefits of Resistance Training

There are numerous benefits of adding resistance training to your routine, such as:

- Improve body composition
- Increase bone mineral density
- Reduce the risk of falls in later life, specifically, diabetes

It can help minimize the long-term impacts of diabetes-related complications associated with progressive insulin resistance.

### Regular resistance training benefits

Regular resistance training is something that we can all benefit from! Improved body composition, increased bone mineral density, and reduced risk of falls in later life are just some of the many amazing advantages of this modality of exercise.

### Importance of resistance training for blood glucose management

Something you may not have considered is how effective resistance training can be for the management of blood glucose levels within the human body. In Australia between 2017-2018, around 1.2 million Australians were diagnosed with diabetes. Exercise, along with other lifestyle factors, plays an important role in minimizing the long-term impacts of diabetes-related complications associated with progressive insulin resistance.

### What is Insulin Resistance?

Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that controls the amount of glucose in the bloodstream by allowing glucose to be stored in muscles. In the case of insulin resistance, muscle cells are unresponsive to insulin, leading to an inability to regulate blood sugar levels. Insulin resistance is progressive and can result from unhealthy lifestyle behaviors like physical inactivity, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and poor dietary habits.

---

### How resistance training improves blood glucose management

Muscles are the primary storage space for glucose in the form of glycogen. The more muscle mass available, the more glucose can be stored, reducing the amount of glucose circulating in the bloodstream. Exercise increases insulin action and glucose tolerance for 24-72 hours, making insulin receptors more sensitive to insulin's action.

---

### Australian Guidelines for Physical Activity

- Breaking up periods of prolonged sitting every 20-30 minutes
- 150-300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise weekly or 75-150 minutes of vigorous intensity
- Minimum of 2 resistance-based exercise sessions weekly on non-consecutive days using major muscle groups
- 8-10 exercises per session, 2-3 sets per exercise, and 8-10 repetitions per set

---

### Where to Start?

Coming into the new year is a great time to set new health goals. Investing in your health can be as simple as incorporating more movement into your daily routine or starting with basic resistance training using household items. For those more advanced, a gym setting may be necessary to continue challenging yourself. Encourage individuals with conditions like diabetes to engage in regular physical activity for their health.

## Bodybuilding Concepts: Bulking Up vs. Cutting

Two concepts you commonly hear in bodybuilding discussions are those relating to bulking up or leaning down in a process referred to as ‘cutting’. When it comes to gaining body weight or dropping body-fat some different considerations need to be made, such as learning about macronutrients, how to maintain and calculate calories, energy output and the role of resistance training.

---

## Content

### 1. Macronutrients

Energy Intake relates to the macronutrients we consume in food, these can include protein, fat, and carbohydrate. All of which contain calories, more specifically 4 calories per gram of protein and carbohydrate and 9 calories per gram of fat. To build muscle or gain weight, it is important to remember that eating more calories than your maintenance calories is required to fuel performance and recovery, this is termed ‘caloric surplus’. Alternatively, if an individual is looking to lose weight a ‘caloric deficit’ or intake below maintenance is preferred.

### 2. What is ‘maintenance’ and how do I calculate it?

Maintenance calories refer to an energy balance between basal metabolism, energy intake through food or drink, and energy output via structured exercise and incidental physical activity. There are plenty of online calculators available (provided below) that will help determine your energy requirements based on factors including current activity levels, age, body weight, and goals. Maintenance simply refers to the calories that need to be consumed to maintain consistent body weight. If you are looking to add lean mass 300-500 calories above this maintenance is advised and vice versa if you are looking to lose weight. This is only a ballpark figure and is contextually based on individuals circumstances, subsequently, there should never be a one size fits all approach.

[https://tdeecalculator.net/](https://tdeecalculator.net/)

### 3. Energy output and the role of resistance training.

In order to preserve muscle during a calories deficit, it is important to prioritize structured resistance. Regular weight training while in a calorie deficit can help you lose body fat, maintain your metabolism, and preserve existing muscle tissue. A common mistake many individuals make when cutting down is reducing their workout intensity and increasing the volume of their training. Focus on major compound movements like pull-ups, dips, bench press, squats, or deadlifts, and avoid excessive training volume. Instead, focus on your dietary modifications using low-intensity steady-state cardio or high-intensity interval training as tools to further increase your deficit into a cut. Similarly, if you are looking to add weight, focusing on progressive overload with your major compound exercises whilst fueling your recovery with plenty of high-quality nutrients and adequate sleep will help optimize recovery and subsequently protein synthesis.

Consistency over all else is always the key to achieving your goals! Whether you are looking to add size to your frame in the new-year or trim a few extra kilograms after an indulgent Christmas period, remember you can’t expect to achieve optimal results without a clear plan. Start by writing yourself a clear training program picking 3-5 exercises with 3-4 sets on each focusing on major compound movements 3-5 times each week. Calculate your calorie requirements to meet your goals whilst considering your career and daily activity levels. Devise a gradual plan to either remove calories and increase cardio progressively over an extended period, or increase calories as lean mass and strength increases. As a general rule of thumb weight losses or gains of 0.25-0.5kg per week are ideal to ensure either you aren’t gaining excessive fat mass during a bulk or losing excessive lean mass during a cutting phase!

# Sprinting

Let's get to know more about Sprinting! Its benefits, the differences between sprinting and jogging, how sprinting helps in building/gaining muscle, and the best time to do it. Bonus part of this blog, recommended supplements to improve and assist your sprint training.

Benefits of Sprinting
- Increases your stamina
- Burns lots of calories in a short time
- Boosts your metabolism
- Improves body composition
- Improves cardiovascular health
- Reduces stress
- Every sport has a form of acceleration and sprinting such as footy, soccer, basketball, and tennis to name a few
- Sprinting requires no equipment and can be performed with family and friends as different abilities don’t change anything

---

Differences Between Sprinting and Jogging

Sprinting is also known to help burn calories long after your session, this is called excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC). Jogging doesn’t have these same benefits. It also helps form your abs and improve your core structure due to the intense pace your body is moving at.

If building muscle is your goal, then adding in high-intensity sprinting would also be beneficial. Whereas jogging would be utilized more in warm-ups and getting your cardio in for the week.

Sprinting will increase your heart rate quickly and reach a higher level than if you were jogging and then would start to decrease once you have stopped. As jogging goes for longer at a moderate pace, your heart rate will not reach the same level as if you were sprinting. It would instead increase to a certain level and plateau for the length of the jog. Both jogging and sprinting give different benefits but both improving your cardiovascular system.

---

If you have never given sprinting a go, definitely try it out. It can be more enjoyable than jogging as you can push yourself harder and have lots of small breaks. Remember to always do a good warm-up before starting so your body is ready to run at a fast intensity, and most of all, have fun with pushing yourself towards your goal.

## Pre-Workout Clumping

There are so many questions surrounding pre-workout clumping. Why is my pre-workout clumping? Is it safe to use? Read further as we answer these questions and give you a few tips on how to prevent pre-workout clumping.

---

## Content

---

You are ready to get pumped for your next training and you reach out for your favourite tub of pre-workout only to find that it has all clumped up together or has hardened.

Has it gone bad? Is it still safe to use?  

This question of concern is no stranger for our customer service team. In fact, clumpy pre-workout supplements are quite common in the industry and there are a few reasons why this happens. Read further as we answer some of the most asked questions surrounding clumped pre-workouts.

## Why is my pre-workout clumping?

Pre-workouts made with natural ingredients have a greater tendency to clump compared to those made with synthetic ingredients but its safe to say that its effectivity is not compromised.

If you have had pre-workouts before that did not clump up easily, it may have had artificial 'anti-caking' agents added to it, which VPA® pre-workouts don't have.

## Made with natural ingredients

Pre-workouts made with natural ingredients have a greater tendency to clump compared to those made with synthetic ingredients but its safe to say that its effectivity is not compromised.

If you have had pre-workouts before that did not clump up easily, it may have had artificial 'anti-caking' agents added to it, which VPA® pre-workouts don't have.

## Hygroscopic ingredients

Hygroscopic ingredients are substances that easily attract water molecules at room temperature. If you have been using our pre-workouts, then you would be familiar with some of these hygroscopic ingredients found in VPA® pre-workouts:

- L-Carnitine
- Beta Alanine
- Citrulline Malate
- Creatine Monohydrate
- AAKG

Of course, not all pre-workouts are made with the same ingredients. Each of these pure amino acids which have hygroscopic properties provide a specific function to give you the needed kick to maximise your strength and enhance your performance during your training.

You may purchase [pure amino acids here.](https://www.vpa.com.au/collections/amino-acids)

---

## Storage Environment

Now that we know that your favourite pre-workouts have hygroscopic ingredients that are susceptible to clumping, ensure that you store them properly in a cool, dry place with controlled temperatures. It is worth noting that extreme or excessive heat temperatures will accelerate the clumping process.

Make sure the lid is properly closed after opened.

---

## Not used often

Clumping usually happens to tubs of pre-workout supplements that have not been used for a while. The best tip is to stir or shake and use them often to ensure that they have not settled.

---

## Is it safe to use clumpy pre-workout?

Yes, it is. Clumping in pre-workouts are natural due to the ingredients that are added to the pre-workout formula. Clumping in pre-workouts does not affect the safety, quality, and effectiveness of the product.

When it comes to the safety of sports supplements, there is no cause for worry. The supplements may be a little clumpy in their natural form, but they're perfectly safe when taken as directed.

However, once the product has been opened, we advise you to consume within 6 weeks.

---

## How to prevent or fix clumping pre-workouts

### Keep the silica packets buried in your pre-workout

Every tub of VPA® pre-workout has a silica packet in them. These packets help absorb any moisture from the product. While most people remove these upon opening a fresh tub of pre-workout, keep them inside and buried in your pre-workout to absorb any moisture after being opened.

---

### Break in your clumped pre-workout with a knife

If it's too late and you're now faced with a clumped up and hardened pre-workout, don’t worry! Break up the chunks of pre-workout with a fork or a knife. Others also opt to chuck them in a blender or food processor.

Otherwise, if it doesn't bother you too much, hard or clumped pre-workouts should dissolve easily in water and will give the same desired effect.

# How to Gain Muscle Efficiently

One of the biggest questions in the fitness space is how to gain muscle as quickly and efficiently as possible. Accredited Practising Dietitian, Aidan Muir, discusses best practises on approaching calorie surplus for muscle gain.

---

## Content

## Variables Involved

The first thing I want to point out is that there is not going to be a stock standard answer. I am going to assume that everybody reading this article is doing some form of resistance training. If the goal is muscle gain, then that is obviously going to be important.

If you enter a calorie surplus without any training stimulus, you will likely still gain some muscle, but [the ratio of fat to muscle is going to be terrible](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2336074/).

 

## Textbook Recommendations and the Issue With Them

Personally, my first proper introduction into concepts related calories and macros came from spending time on the bodybuilding.com forums. On that forum, people would talk about how a 500 calorie surplus would result in roughly a 1/2kg per week weight gain. And a 1000kcal per day surplus would be double that at almost 1kg per week.

This is backed up by similar recommendations in nutrition textbooks that that base it on the composition of muscle mass and how much energy is required to create that muscle mass.

Muscle is roughly 75% water, 20% protein and 5% fat, glycogen and other minerals and metabolites. So these calculations are often based off a combination of the calories required to build that amount of muscle, using the amount of calories required for the protein, fat and glycogen.

I like the simplicity of this idea, but unfortunately, it is more complex than this.

 

### Reasons why it can be almost impossible to come up with a clean number include:

1. As calorie intake increases, the number of calories burned through the thermic effect of food increases. The thermic effect of food is typically [8-15% of total daily energy expenditure.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12499328/)
2. As calorie intake increase, calories burned through non-exercise activity thermogenesis typically increases. And this impact varies drastically different in different individuals
3. As calorie intake increases and energy availability improves, the basal metabolic rate might adjust slightly. This impact is more pronounced if coming from a low energy availability state where the body had to down-regulate some processes that burn calories.
4. When you are on restricted calories, the body can become slightly more “efficient” during exercise and burn slightly fewer calories. Obviously, in a surplus, energy expenditure can change related to that.

There are a whole bunch more factors. But this dramatically increases complexity. For example, if you give somebody a 500kcal surplus, is it ACTUALLY a 500kcal surplus if their energy expenditure increases by 250kcal due to having more calories coming in? One person’s expenditure might increase by a small amount, while another person’s might increase by a larger amount.

The way I look at it, although we have heaps of ways we can theoretically think about this, all that we really care about is what happens in practice. We only really care about what ratio is muscle vs fat at different calorie surplus sizes.

 

## So What Is The Ideal Size?

Even though this is an area that a lot of people are curious about there is a surprisingly [small amount of research on the topic](https://journals.lww.com/nsca-scj/Abstract/publishahead/Magnitude_and_Composition_of_the_Energy_Surplus.99278.aspx).

- **For people who are new to training** and have everything in their favour, 1-2kg per month is probably going to be ideal.
- **For females** I would likely go at the more conservative end of that spectrum.
- **As people progress**, I would look at slowing it down towards that <0.5kg per month mark at the other end of the extreme, for somebody really close to their potential.

Going higher than these rates is okay if you are willing to embrace some more fat gain. From an anecdotal perspective, it is interesting to note that from I can tell, a large percentage of people who have done a major transformation with their physique over the years have done something called a “dreamer bulk” at some stage.

# Caffeine Tolerance: Understanding the Effects and Resetting Strategies

Caffeine is one of the known and most effective stimulants used to improve performance but when not taken properly, it might lead to caffeine tolerance. In this blog we will tackle the benefits of caffeine, the causes of caffeine tolerance, and ways to reset caffeine tolerance.

---

## Content

## Benefits of Caffeine

Caffeine is an alkaloid compound found particularly in tea and coffee, other performance supplements like [pre-workouts](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/supplements/the-benefits-of-pre-workout) or [fat burners](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/hyperburn-fx), and energy drinks. Often, we are familiar with the use of caffeine to prevent tiredness, caffeine helps keep us awake and alert by competing with a molecule that promotes tiredness called adenosine. Caffeine prevents adenosine from binding to its receptors as it has a very similar molecular shape! So how does caffeine provide a physical performance benefit?

## Effects of Caffeine Tolerance

Across the available literature, various means with which caffeine provides a physical performance benefit have been assessed primarily focusing on how it attenuates the response of the central nervous system!

- Helps make us more alert.
- Increases motor activity and physiological arousal whilst also reducing our perception of pain or effort.
- Many endurance athletes turn to caffeine supplementation as it serves to reduce the body’s need for muscle glycogen storage, and in the short term prioritizes free fatty acids sparring those all-important glycogen stores for later in a race.
- Strength athletes utilize caffeine as a means to increase strength and muscular endurance.

## How are caffeine supplements often administered?

Caffeine can be taken in many forms. As mentioned at the beginning of this article there are plenty of powders on the market that contain caffeine, however, most commonly, caffeine is administered via anhydrous means like capsule form. When taken in doses of around 3-7 mg per kilogram of body mass, there is an associated performance benefit of 24% (McLellan & Bell et al., 2004). As identified above individuals who take larger quantities of caffeine frequently over time are at risk of tolerance to the effects of caffeine.

## Caffeine Tolerance Reset

If you find that your usual cup of joe or your pre-workout isn't providing the same jolt of focus or energy it used to provide you with, avoid switching to higher doses of caffeine supplements and consider doing a caffeine tolerance reset to feel the buzz. Since caffeine tolerance is acquired over time, then taking a caffeine detox should help reset or clear the amount of caffeine in your system. Caffeine detoxes can vary from person to person and may result into withdrawals for some cases so best ease into it.

**Caffeine withdrawals may include:**
- headaches
- fatigue; low energy
- poor concentration
- irritability
- anxiety

## Summary

Caffeine tolerance occurs when the effects are reduced with regular consumption where a chronically high intake of caffeine leads to an up-regulation of the adenosine receptors. Caffeine can be a strong ergogenic aid for both strength and endurance athletes if used appropriately. However, if you have a caffeine addiction you may need to remove it temporarily from your diet to re-sensitize yourself.

Be selective and when planning your training implement a specific methodical approach to caffeine use, if on certain days you are trying to prioritize strength a pre-workout supplement can give yourself the boost you need. If you are an endurance athlete you may prefer to save supplementation for days where you have time trials or longer runs to help spare those glycogen stores.

This March, VPA® choose to celebrate International Women's Month by highlighting our inspiring VPA® Women athletes starting with Raissa Vogler. Her fitness journey started from bodybuilding, transitioned to powerlifting and now, Strongwoman. In this blog she'll share her journey in the said sport, from her struggles as a beginner, how she prepares for competitions, and tips on becoming a Strongwoman.

### 1. What’s the best thing about being a Strongwoman athlete? What do you enjoy most about it?

The challenge! It is a sport which provides a lot of mental stimulation and I guess that is what made it so attractive in the first place. I really enjoy that no event is ever the same. One competition might consist of a heavy yoke run over 20m & a max log, another might include the log and yoke as part of a medley. The fun component to this sport is there is always something new to work on & it allows myself as an athlete to keep expanding my skillset.

### 2. How do you condition your body and mind when training for competitions?

I need to just switch off and get the work done. If I’m in a comp prep, you’ll often see me with my headphones in and my resting bitch face on … quite literally. Sometimes training sessions don’t go to plan, and you need to be okay with accepting the good & bad, and growing from it.

#### How does a typical training for a strong woman athlete look like?

This depends on the time in the year, I’m either prepping for a comp or working on weakness in off season, while maintaining my strengths & movement patterns. My year may usually include about 4-5 comps ranging from local comps to Arnold’s Strongman Australia and planning for International level.

### 3. What’s the recommended diet or fuel when preparing for Strongwoman competitions?

Ensure you have a good balance of macros, drink plenty of water and understand the calorie intake you need to perform. Sometimes I struggle to get my protein in, so my VPA® WPI Protein is super handy to have in the cupboard all the time. Fruits & veggies are also incredibly important, so I’ll always ensure I’m getting a variety of colors. For an athlete, carbs mean fuel, so it’s important to ensure I’m consuming enough.

### 4. Can you give us one advice for anyone wanting to work their way up and join strongwoman competitions?

Don’t think, if you want to do it then just go for it, you never know until you try. It’s what I did, and I’ve never looked back.

### 5. What's your favorite VPA® supplement? What are the products you recommend, especially for those who are in strength sports?

VPA® WPI Protein in my protein oats every morning for breakfast. There are so many flavor varieties and I love mixing it up. I also take creatine & super greens on the daily, something I’d definitely recommend. I also love the Protein Balls, but I’d end up eating too many of them they are that yummy haha.

### Here are a few reasons why women ought to be doing more weight training

1. **More muscle mass = higher metabolism**

The most common misconception is that the best way to weight loss is by doing tons of cardio. Sure, cardio burns tons of calories during your workout. But weight training causes your body to burn more calories all day, even at rest. We’ve discussed the [pros and cons of cardio versus weight training](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/training/weights-vs-cardio) here to help you decide.

**Bottom-line:** Weight lifting burns fat and transforms your figure in many ways cardio can’t.

2. **Hitting aesthetic goals**

Most women fall back into the idea that lifting weights will make them look bulky. Ladies, we don’t turn into Arnie after a few weight training sessions! Lifting weights strengthens the muscles. We don’t bulk up the same way men do because it is simply not part of our female genetic makeup.

Lifting heavy helps you achieve the sculpted body we all envy, can build the ideal glutes, and build that perfect hour-glass figure. It’s a lot of consistent physical work and eating to aid in muscle growth which means incorporating more protein into your diet.

Now a year after the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, we find a stronger and shared global awareness for the importance of our overall health and hygiene protocols to avoid getting sick. Building a healthy lifestyle is vital for us to maintain our health and wellbeing during these challenging times.

Here’s a quick checklist to ensure you’re all set on the path to a healthier lifestyle.

## Boost your immune system

Our immune system works to defend the body against invading toxins and bacteria so strengthening it is key. A great way to do so is by trading off unhealthy habits for a healthier lifestyle by consuming fresh and nutritious food, engaging in regular exercise, and getting good sleep. In the midst of the pandemic stress and anxiety, we know how hard it can be to keep this up but we’re here to give you a few tips to make it easy.

You may already have these immune boosters lying around the kitchen, if not, remember to grab some at your local grocery store and incorporate them into your homemade meals.

- Citrus fruits – high in Vitamin C
- Capsicums
- Broccoli – is supercharged with vitamins and minerals. It is packed with vitamins A, C, and E, as well as fiber and many other antioxidants.
- Garlic
- Ginger – helps decrease inflammation.
- Spinach – packed with numerous antioxidants and also rich in Vitamin C.
- Yogurt – good source of vitamin D and probiotic cultures that strengthen the digestive track.
- Turmeric – is an anti-inflammatory. It can help decrease exercise-induced muscle damage.
- Green Tea – good source of amino acid L-Theanine

Sometimes when we fail to get the right nutrients from our food, a great way to boost your immune system is by taking supplements. We have created a list of VPA supplements for health and wellbeing [here](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/supplements/four-supplements-to-boost-your-health-and-wellbeing).

**This includes:**

- **Collagen Pro** - is ideal for those who want to maximise their gut health.
- **Multi Greens** – contains a blend of Super Greens: barley grass, wheat grass, spirulina. PA Multi Greens is also high in vitamins, minerals, proteins, enzymes and antioxidants that can ensure optimal cell function and effective protein and nutrient absorption.
- **L-Glutamine**- has strong muscle building properties and works to repair muscle fibers quickly and reduce recovery times between training. L-glutamine also promotes good gut health.

# Why are injuries in sports training so common?

We train to become stronger, and better, yet we find ourselves in the worst case scenario of getting injured. In this blog we'll tackle tips on how you can make most out of your training, and preventing injuries to happen.

When it comes to training, there is nothing worse than getting injured! Injuries are not only a huge setback for your performance, but can also be extremely taxing mentally. For athletes, getting injured is by far their worst case scenario, sometimes it can mean the end of a season or even a playing career. In this article I wanted to address a few strategies that you can implement to help you stay at the top of your game!

As a strength and conditioning coach, I’ve seen it all too many times. Injuries happening as a result of poor judgement and decision making. Don’t get me wrong, most often there are plenty of other factors at play. However, you want to ensure you are doing everything within your control to train at the best of your ability.

Here’s what you can do to make the most of your training, and prevent injuries from happening:

## 1. Perfect Your Technique

Technique is paramount. Understanding your individual biomechanics and how your body moves (especially when under load) is crucial to performing well and preventing injuries from occurring. Whether it’s in the weight room or out on the field, often having a second pair of eyes to give you feedback on how your body is moving is crucial towards developing and improving. You know what they say, practice makes perfect!

## 2. Take the time to Warm Up

Don’t rush your warm up. The goal of any warm up is prepare the body for motion and prime for the session that is about to be performed. Similar to a race car revving its engine before the starting gun goes off! Making sure your body has adequate blood flow, optimal temperature and joint congruency are all factors that can make the introduction of higher intensity modalities a lot smoother. Take the time to plan your warm ups!

## 3. Recover Properly

One of the most common ways to get injured is from overtraining. This is where your body is put under too much load and essentially burns out. Implementing adequate recovery strategies such as a good night’s sleep, a nutritious diet, supplementation and incorporating active recovery training sessions can be more effective ways to manage this load. Just remember, your body’s ability to perform is only as good as its ability to recover.

## 4. Leave Your Ego at the Door

Believe it or not, this can be one of the biggest reasons why people get injured. They try to perform something that is outside of their capability. Of course, you train to get better and improve. However, being smart about the weights you select or the intensities you train at are ways to prevent any injuries from occurring. Don’t be afraid to run a little slower, or take some weight off the bar. Knowing what you are capable of doing is massively influential towards how you will perform. For years, most Olympic weightlifters will just use the bar without any weight so they can optimise their technique and the way their body moves. Leave your ego at the door and always keep in mind that your only competition is yourself!

Leave your ego at the door and always keep in mind that your only competition is yourself! So there it is! My top 4 tips to make the most of your training and prevent injuries from occurring! Sometimes it’s simply a matter of training smarter not harder. Good luck!

## So, you’re fresh out of uni and keen as mustard to kick start your career as a strength and conditioning coach! How exciting! Whether it’s chasing a dream of making it onto a pro-sporting team as the head strength and conditioning (S&C) coach, or opening your own gym one day, how do you go from a fresh graduate to coaching athletes?

If you’re not prepared to work for it, then this industry is not for you - period. Becoming a strength and conditioning coach is completely different to becoming certified as a personal trainer. These days, anyone can jump online and get their Cert III/IV in fitness in a matter of weeks. Becoming a S&C coach is a whole other ball game.

Most fresh graduates want to work in pro-sport and coach elite athletes straight away! The reality is it just doesn’t work that way. Like any industry, you need to climb the ladder. Here are my top tips for how you can break into the S&C industry!

1. Coaching experience is king. A good S&C coach is someone that can coach anyone. Athletes, general population, youth… you name it. In your early days of developing your coaching skills, expose yourself to a wide range of clients and put yourself in different environments. From being a F45 Group Fitness instructor, to the person running the warm up for a whole footy club, to working 1on1. Having a wide range of coaching experience is the thing that will look great on your resume… not a master’s degree.

2. Do an internship In the S&C industry, the internship is almost considered a rite of passage. Every coach started out as an intern. An internship is a set program run by an organisation designed to teach the basics of coaching, programming and training. You will be lucky to find one of these that are paid. My internship went for 7 months where it was all volunteer work. Show up because you are passionate and eager to learn, as this is a crucial stepping stone for getting your foot in the door.

3. Train and test your own programs There is nothing worse than a coach who can’t lift. You know what they say, you can never trust a skinny chef! Well, the same goes here. As a coach, you are a leader. You lead by example. This means training, building your own athleticism, trailing, testing, failing, adjusting your own programs will allow you to get the best results for anyone you train. Training yourself gives you skin in the game, as you will be able to relate to what your client is going through. This is also a huge factor in building trust between you and your clients.

4. Seek out learning and networking opportunities The S&C world is full of different networking and learning opportunities for you to immerse yourself in! Whether it’s a seminar on Olympic lifting, or how to cue effectively, expose yourself to as many of these as you can! Not only will you be learning, but it’s also a great chance to network and meet new people in the industry.

5. Get a mentor Having a mentor early on is crucial. This is someone you can trust, bounce ideas off, train with, get feedback from, as they have “been there done that”. Getting feedback on how you are performing is crucial towards improving, even though sometimes you might not like what they have to say. Embrace the hustle and feedback you receive from a mentor, as they are coming from a place of experience, and it’s only going to make you better!

Becoming a S&C Coach is not everyone, but damn it’s a rewarding career. Sitting here today writing this, I feel like I have the best job in the world. You definitely have your work cut out for you initially, but once you have some more experience under the belt, its incredible! If you are passionate about training, coaching, and changing people’s lives… then becoming a S&C coach is for you.

Good luck breaking into the industry! Hope to see you on the other side.

### School Holidays and Staying Fit While Traveling

School holidays have seemed to come rolling in quicker than ever- it only feels like yesterday we were trying to keep those darling children entertained at home in the last school holidays (edit: if you are from Victoria of NSW, you were most likely keeping them home very recently with the snap lockdown!). But if you are anything like me, the thought of staying around home for an entire 14 days does not sound ideal- you will have already organised your next trip away from home. I know you probably feel like you have only just started to get back into the fitness movement- it’s only been two weeks since the GYMS have officially been able to open up again, so you don’t want to lose your momentum. Here are some great ideas to stay fit while traveling:

The Australian Government had some guidelines that I believe are more important now than ever before, that is to think of movement as an opportunity, not an inconvenience. This is where any form of movement is seen as an opportunity for improving health, not as a time-wasting inconvenience. The advances in technology these days have meant that a lot of the activities that humans once did that involved movement have been reduced significantly. But, years and years of human evolution have shown us that we, the hunter and gatherers, need to move our bodies for optimal health. Instead of opting for a cruisy holiday down by the beach, why not take the tents and bikes out and camp down the river. Not only will you have ample more opportunities to move your body but you will be in abundance of fresh air, Vitamin D and be engulfed in our beautiful scenery.

#### Simple Ways to Stay Active While Traveling

- Instead of taking the lift, opt for the staircase if you are staying in a hotel and get that heart rate up!
- Choose to park the car a few blocks away so that you need to walk more than a few meters.
- Try some body-weight exercises such as planks, sit-ups, mountain-climbers, jump-squats, forward and backward lunges, push-ups. Aim for 60 seconds of work with 30 seconds of rest in between.
- Aim for a sunrise or sunset walk and witness Mother Nature’s beauty.
- Make use of the time you spend lining up in queues - add in some sumo squats or lunges to help pass the time.
- Pack a super light resistance band into your suitcase - these cheap and easily transportable pieces of equipment allow you to do pulling movements that are sometimes hard to do without weights or a pull-up bar. If you haven’t got one- just try to make do with any of the equipment that you have with you. For example: door frames for chin-ups!

---

Staying fit while traveling also involves ensuring that you are eating well, you don’t always need to be eating high-sugar and salt pre-packaged foods. Being prepared with your snacks is the best way to avoid making those irrational decisions fueled by hunger. Try some of these easy snacks:

- Sliced vegetables such as capsicum, cucumber, tomatoes, and celery are a great combination with a tzatziki or hummus dip. Not only are they cost-effective and tasty, but they are full of fiber and essential vitamins and minerals.

---

### Enjoy Your Travels!

It’s also important that during this trying time, we ensure that we are practicing Covid Safety. These include:

- Keeping a safe distance from other travelers (1.5 meters)
- Try limiting your contact with frequently touched surfaces, such as handrails, shared cooking facilities, or recreational areas and if you can’t avoid contact; making sure you sanitize regularly.
- Keep a pack of face masks, hand sanitizer, and disinfectant wipes in an easy-to-reach place at all times so that you are prepared.
- Clean your hands often - especially after fueling your car!

Enjoy your travels!

If there’s one huge benefit to come out of this pandemic other than personal and communal hygiene, it’s the role of technology!

## Importance of Warming Up Before a Workout

While warming up before your workout may not feel like it is very important, it is vital to improving your performance, and keeping you safe from injury. The main goal of warming up/stretching is to get your body primed and ready before your training.

---

## Content

Today we are going to be talking about something that might not be very fun. However, this is something you should not skip out on, despite feeling like it is pointless.

Yes, we are talking about stretching. While warming up before your workout may not feel like it is very important, it is vital to improving your performance, and keeping you safe from injury. The main goal of warming up/ stretching is to get your body primed and ready before your training.

Whether you’re a professional bodybuilder, powerlifter or everyday gym goer, warming up is crucial and should not be neglected for your event.

You might think of doing a quick quad stretch, swing your arms back and forth, and then think you’re good to go. Sadly, that’s not the case. Remember, stretching must be done properly for it to protect you from hindering your performance.

---

### What is Static Stretching?

Static stretching is the type we are more used to. Static stretching is extending a muscle and holding it anywhere between 15 to 30 seconds. Repeating it 2 - 4 times to reach about the 60 second mark.

A perfect example is stretching your quads. To do so, you can stand tall, lift up one leg and bend your knee and bring your foot to your butt to stretch the quad hold that position for 15 - 30 seconds.

The goal of static stretching is to help release tension in your muscles. This will help increase the length and flexibility of the muscle and potentially reduce the risk of pulls or strains.

---

### Best time to use:

Contrary to what the majority is used to, static stretches are **best done after your workout** as part of your cool down to help relieve any muscle tension cause by your training. Static stretches help loosen the muscle, alleviate any tightness, and provides better blood flow to help with recovery.

---

### What is Dynamic Stretching?

Dynamic stretching, like static stretching, aims to boost your range of motion, flexibility, and prepare you for your workout. However, you do not hold the stretch in one place for 15 - 30 seconds.

The goal of dynamic stretching is to get the body moving. Dynamic stretching is more focused on “active stretching”. This means taking the joints and the muscles through the full range of motion, so it starts in a shortened position and then all the way into the full lengthened position.

So just think “static” means no movement with the stretch and dynamic means moving through the full range of motion to get a stretch.

---

### Best time to use:

As dynamic stretches fully prepare and condition your body for your workout, the best time to use dynamic stretches are before you begin your workout. Ideally you want to focus on taking your whole body through a dynamic stretch routine before your workout and not just the muscles you “think” you’re going to use. This is because the body doesn’t work in isolation and all muscles work together which means to get the best return on investment from dynamic stretching, using a whole-body approach will be best.

So if you are not already practicing the two types of stretches in your workout routine, add them to your routine today to help maximize their benefits and improve your performance and recovery.

# Fat Burners: Separating Myth from Reality

Some people swear by fat burners- those “magic pills” that make fat disappear like ice cream off their bodies. The greatest fat burners aren't magic. In fact, they are basically vitamins. Even while they're made with substances that may help you burn fat more effectively; they cannot substitute a healthy diet and regular exercise.

## Some people swear by fat burners

Some people swear by fat burners- those “magic pills” that make fat disappear like ice cream off their bodies. The greatest fat burners aren't magic. In fact, they are basically vitamins. Even while they're made with substances that may help you burn fat more effectively; they cannot substitute a healthy diet and regular exercise.

## Let’s break down how fat burners work for the best results.

## How do fat burners work and what’s in them?

Caffeine is the primary component in most fat burners. Caffeine aids in weight loss by boosting metabolism and assisting the body in burning fat for fuel. Additionally, it contributes to the energy required for exercise and other calorie-burning activities. Other ingredients that you will find in most fat burners are Acetyl Carnitine, Green Tea Extract, and Yohimbine - because these ingredients also help increase your metabolism.

A [fat burner](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/supplements/what-are-fat-burners) can’t fix a broken diet. If you're eating for healthy fat loss then a thermogenic fat burner can assist with the rest: boosting energy, assisting in hunger suppression, encouraging fat use for energy, and even raising your metabolism and core temperature—a process known as "thermogenesis” where you burn more calories throughout the day.

## When do you start seeing results when taking Fat Burners?

You need to consider what sort of diet you are on and how consistent you are with sticking to your food regime as that will play a big part with the fat burners that you are taking. Usually, it takes around 2-3 weeks to see results, depending how strong the fat burners that you are taking. But if you hit 6-7 weeks and you do not see results, you must change products as everyone is different and we all have different lifestyles and food regime. Remember, its always about trial and error on which fat burners fit you.

## Difference between Fat Burners (Pills) and Fat Burner Pre-workouts (Thermogenics)

A ‘fat burner' is a supplement that contains plant extracts, vitamins, and minerals. It's essential to note that most of these supplements aren't ‘magic pills' and can't ‘burn' fat on their own. But they may offer components which may help you on your health and fitness quest.

On the other hand, a [‘pre-workout’](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/pre-30-v2-pre-workout) is a supplement that usually comes in the form of a flavoured powder to be combined into a drink and includes a variety of components designed to assist you throughout your workouts, whether at the gym or while participating in sports. Stimulants like caffeine, as well as vitamins, minerals, and plant extracts, are common components in pre-workout supplements.

# Keeping Fit During COVID-19 Lockdowns

Keeping fit during the COVID-19 lockdowns is one of the challenges that society is currently facing. So we’ve gathered some fun and enjoyable ideas to achieve better performance adaptation trainings.

---

## Content

Keeping fit during the COVID-19 lockdowns is one of the challenges that society is currently facing. Whether it be a lack of motivation, inability to access resources or equipment, and inability to socialise in environment, which for some is a place to blow off some steam away from home. Work from home arrangements, coupled with exercising from home, and the inability to travel has made work-life balance very tough.

So we’ve gathered some fun and enjoyable ideas to achieve better performance adaptation trainings.

## Blood Flow Restriction Training

*Blood flow restriction training* is a technique that was developed by Dr Yoshiaki Sato in Japan 1966 as a means of maintaining muscle during immobilisation. Resistance training for bone mineral density and the maintenance of muscle mass underpins musculoskeletal health. Whether you are a young athlete trying to maintain muscle mass or older individual trying to maintain functional capacity in a home-based setting, BFR or Blood Flow Restriction Training can be a useful strategy. Some studies have shown that strength training at 20-30% 1 RM have been shown to elicit comparable improvements in muscle mass to training at 70% 1 RM. Obviously, sing heavy loads above 70% 1 RM in your living room is going to present some challenges so BFR is a potential avenue which could provide some food for thought.

![Blood Flow Restriction Training](https://i.shgcdn.com/a8656d58-4bd8-4fce-8d0a-2bf1e105570a/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

One can go for smart adjustable weights that take up minimal space within the home. Make sure these weights provide a fantastic option to allow for progressive overload in a home-based setting without requiring the space of a typical rack of weights.

---

## Activity Monitors

If you are new to exercise or simply enjoy your afternoon walks or runs, activity monitors are a fantastic way to record steps, kilometres and even record challenges with friends. Fitbit, Garmin, Apple produce fantastic products which you can pair with your phones or earpieces to help you better monitor outdoor activities. Research continually demonstrates the synergistic benefit of combining physical activity and connectedness to the great ‘outdoors’, and how this could be a powerful tool to help fight to growing incidence of non-communicable disease and physical inactivity.

Online communication platforms like zoom provide an environment where you can connect with friends or family to keep each other accountable. If you are looking for online exercise classes [Walk at home](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVl6ZdslZz2Zj-34bMJFPbg) has exercise video options which are great for to try with the whole clan.

Alternatively, you might like to start a [step challenge](https://www.10000steps.org.au/) with friends to ensure you are also reaping the benefits of the great outdoors! Just ensure you are wearing your VPA® mask in accordance with public health guidelines and to show your support for the VPA® team.

## There have been tremendous changes in people's lives because of the pandemic. We thought it would end in 2021, but it continued on. Everything has been affected, including a person's physical and mental health. These changes may be massive or subtle. One may not even notice that there is a shift or change in their physical and psychological state. One thing that a person can do is make sure that they start to eat healthier. Why?

There have been articles that found a [correlation between nutrition and mental health](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/nutrition-and-mental-health-is-there-a-link). This means that people should be consciously aware of how their psychology is affected by the current global situation. Awareness is always the first step.

Amidst all the chaos, the best thing anyone can do is look out for their physical and mental wellbeing. One's goal is to reach optimal health even when at home. Here are a few reasons why proper nutrition can help you and why it should be your top priority.

## Strengthen Immune System

Your immune system is your first line of defence when it comes to combating diseases. The stronger your immune system, the more likely your body can fight off any pathogens. One way of keeping it strong is by having a healthy diet that helps boost your immunity. Edibles that are [high in Vitamins C](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/multi-greens) have proven to do just that.

There are a few supplements that do promote boosting one's natural defences. However, there is a possibility that some of these claims are true. It would be best if you did your research before taking these supplements.

Make sure that they are a [trusted brand](https://www.vpa.com.au/) and can deliver their claims. You can also strengthen your immunity the natural way. This can be done through adequate nutrition and daily exercise.

## Prevents Other Health Conditions Associated With Improper Eating Habits

One is at risk of developing several nutrition-related diseases if there is a lack or excess in one's diet. If you overeat, you are at risk for obesity. If you eat too little, you are at risk for malnutrition. It is vital to have the perfect balance when it comes to your diet. These are only a few of the conditions that can be prevented.

- Diabetes
- Heart disease
- Obesity
- Malnutrition
- Vitamin deficiencies
- Chronic illness

Eating healthy foods paired with regular exercise is the key to gaining strength. It also helps in lowering the risk factors for any illnesses. Eating healthier food should never become a fad diet and should be a lifestyle change. One should consciously make the proper lifestyle choices.

## Helps You Save Money

Getting sick is expensive. The stronger your body is, the less likely that you will develop any form of the disease. This would save you thousands of dollars from buying medicines or getting hospitalized.

This is also the worst time for anyone to be admitted to any health facility. The focus is on the current virus, and any other health issue might not be given that much attention. Preventive care should be your priority. The critical role of preventive care is to keep one away from any health institution.

Inflation has also been the highest that it has been since 2019. It is expected to increase to 4.1% in 2021, which makes saving money even more crucial.

## Boost Your Mental Health

It is no surprise that food can affect one's mental health. That's why it is essential to eat food that can help boost your mental state. Salmon is just one example of a food that can boost your mood. It has Omega 3 that has proved to be beneficial to the heart and the mind as well. It helps people with mild depression and schizophrenia.

Pain or stiffness in the joints may be a sign of muscle tension or tight fascia. The fascia makes up the connective tissue that surrounds our body parts holding together the organs, bones, muscles. The connective tissue contains nerves making it highly sensitive tissue, it is designed to move with our bodies and helps us to twist and bend without pain!

---

There are a variety of different ways in which Fascia can tighten, the most common culprit is physical inactivity and stress. Sitting down for prolonged periods of time not only leads to tightening of fascia but also presents numerous other significant health risks, if we don’t use the muscles within our body overtime the fascia can tighten or thicken leading to immobility.

---

With our current busy lifestyles, we lead stressful lives there is no denying. Poor posture can also lead to tightening of fascia which can impede nervous system function! The benefits of stretching regularly are vast and include some of the following but aren’t limited to:

- Joint Range of motion and muscle lengthening
- Muscle weakness
- Reduction of injury risk
- Relief of tension and stress
- Help increase body temperature prior to exercise to avoid injury
- Cool Down protocols
- Improvements in posture and movement

Three techniques you can start to incorporate into your daily routine in order to start enjoying the benefits of improved range of motion and flexibility include.

1. **Foam Rolling** – Foam rolling is a form of self myofascial release or could be simply called as “self-massage”. It is a technique that can increase muscle flexibility and can relieve muscle tightness, tension, soreness and inflammation to increase joint range of motion. To avoid rolling over small joints like your knees, elbows or ankles which could cause them to hyperextend aim to roll out each body part separately for 30 seconds-1 minute and repeat for 3-4 sets prioritizing area causing the most tightness of discomfort.

Choosing your foam roller can also be a challenging task with smooth rollers which are often a good, cheaper place to start prior to moving into textured rollers which have more bumps, ridges and knobs that can get into deep knots. Alternatively Foam covered massage sticks and massage balls can be used to target the muscles or the upper back, shoulders or deeply massaging into the legs.

---

2. **Static Stretching** – Static stretching can make a positive difference in how well your muscles recover following physical activity, enhancing your range of motion during athletic performance, improving flexibility and mitigating injury risk. Static stretching involves lengthening the muscle near its furthest point and holding that stretch for 15-20 seconds focusing on a single muscle group with each stretch. Ideally save this type of exercise for after your workouts, particularly if performing strength training. A simple example is a traditional seated hamstring stretch held for 20-30 seconds.

When it comes to training we tend to always focus on the physical elements of exercise, but rarely talk about the role the mind plays in ensuring we are able to give it our all in the gym or weights room. The mind is a powerful muscle just like any other in the body, and if you use it regularly you’ll be surprised about the positive performance benefits you can attain. 

Here are 3 ways in which you can prepare yourself to bring you’re A game in the gym, whether it be your favourite pump-up tune or some mindfulness training we have some strategies for you to think about implementing in your own routine.

### Music

Who doesn’t love assembling their favourite playlist to get them in the mood for a big training session? In research conducted by Thakare et al. (2017) music tempo enhances exercise duration and subsequently endurance performance. Similarly Patania et al. (2020) investigated the psychophysiological effects of music tempo on endurance exercise vs. high intensity performances and found that the performance benefit people receive from listening to music is mostly evident in low to moderate intensity exercise.

---

### Mindfulness Meditation

Mindfulness is a mental state which is achieved through a therapeutic technique focusing on present moment awareness, whilst acknowledging the thoughts, feelings and sensations one is experiencing. Mindfulness is a technique which has garnered much attention over the years for it’s performance benefit. 

Nien et al. (2020) found that in a short 5 week program, mindfulness level, endurance performance and cognitive functions, including executive functions. The best thing about regular mindfulness training is that you only need a couple minutes every day, you can do as little or as much as you like to help you re-centre your mind and body. Some fantastic apps available on the market include Calm, headspace and if you don’t want to pay the in-app purchases for those listed the Smiling mind is another great option.

### Warm Up

Whilst it’s easy to skip over the warm up these days, with our busy lifestyles getting a quick workout in is the most important thing! If that means sacrificing an appropriate warm up or cool down then we often do. Here are a couple reasons why warming up can help you mentally perform to the best of your ability. 

Raalte et al. (2019) investigated the effects of a mental warm up on workout readiness and stress of college student exercisers and found that goal setting, imagery and arousal control facilitate readiness for sport performance. Whilst there is further research required to determine the usefulness of mental warm ups for stress reduction and potential injury reduction, there is a plethora of information to suggest that a short dynamic warm up has benefits both physical and psychological!

### What is BCAA's role in muscle growth and recovery?

BCAA or [Branched-chain amino acids](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/bcaa-2-1-1) are the three essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized by the human body and must be consumed through diet. There is a lot of food where BCAAs can be found. Foods such as chicken, beef, eggs and some vegetables like spinach or broccoli are its main sources. Though you can get it from these products, it may not be enough, primarily if you work out.

You need enough BCAA in your body to fully get its benefits. [The reason](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5568273/) is this: there are nine BCAAs altogether, but the three that are considered to be the most important for muscle growth and recovery are leucine, isoleucine, and valine. BCAA provides these three.

These amino acids contain nitric oxide, which helps regulate blood pressure by widening blood vessels to prevent high blood pressure. They also provide energy to muscles and help with muscle protein synthesis. These amino acids also regulate the metabolism of glucose in the body. They may reduce muscle breakdown and improve exercise performance. Imagine all those benefits in one source!

Magnesium and Its Importance

VPA® Australia has a variety of different products that contain magnesium including **Magnegel** and **ZMA6 Recovery**, so what do these products do and why is magnesium so important?

Magnesium in Our Diet
======================

Magnesium is a workhorse of minerals in the body we need. Generally, magnesium is found within a variety of plant-based foods including dark chocolate, avocados, spinach, some varieties of nuts and seeds, legumes, tofu and whole grains are all great examples. In our bodies there are a vast number of chemical reactions that take place every single day! More than 300 requiring magnesium, it is an important electrolyte supporting musculoskeletal and neurological wellbeing.

The [ZMA6 Recovery](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/supplements/zma6-recovery-boost-your-recovery) product by VPA® contains 200mg per 10 gram serve which is around 62% of the recommended daily intake (RDA) depending on which population you are looking at.

**SEO Title:** 3 Reasons To Incorporate Smoothies Into Your Diet

**SEO Description:** Smoothies are a great way to boost your nutrition and boost energy, especially if you're on the go. Here are three reasons why you should incorporate smoothies into your diet for a healthy lifestyle.

## Boost Fruit and Vegetable Intake

Smoothies are a fantastic way to pack as much nutrition as you can into one drink. They are quick and easy to whip up and they make the perfect meal if prepared and consumed correctly. Smoothies are a great addition to your current diet if you want to increase your protein intake, and get some essential vitamins and minerals. Smoothies can also be a quick meal alternative if you're short on time or aren't able to prepare a full meal. Here are three reasons to incorporate smoothies into your diet.

---

### Increase Fibre In Your Diet

Smoothies are not only delicious but also healthy. They provide a multitude of benefits to your body, including a boost in fibre. Fibre is a vital nutrient aiding indigestion. Not only does it prevent constipation, but it also supports the growth of beneficial bacteria in your digestive tract.

We know that the best way to get more fibre is by eating vegetables and whole grains. However, that can be tedious and time-consuming. Smoothies are an easy way to quickly increase your fibre intake without having to commit much time or effort to do so.

Fibre is a key part of a healthy diet, and smoothies are an easy way to get it. A 1 cup serving provides about 5g, which is up to 50% of your daily recommended fibre intake. Smoothies can also be used to add extra fibre by adding in ingredients like oats or chia seeds.

---

### Tailor smoothies to your taste or dietary preference

Smoothies are a great way to get the nutrition that you need in a balanced and healthy way. Thankfully, they can be tailored to your preference so you can have more freedom in what you drink.

You can add ingredients such as greens, protein, or superfoods to create a recipe that is just perfect for your tastes and needs. You can even add your favourite protein powder to your smoothie to help you in your fitness journey.

Many people argue that smoothies can have too many calories especially when you use fruits that are high in sugar like [passion fruits](https://www.myfooddata.com/articles/high-sugar-fruits.php). But this isn’t true because you can use organic fruit instead of fresh fruits, which has the [same nutritional value but has fewer calories](https://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-wellness/articles/2015/03/13/will-going-organic-help-you-lose-weight).

Plus, the fibre in the vegetables will help regulate your blood sugar levels so you won’t spike it up. Smoothies are a quick, healthy and fast drink that most people love to make.

---

A healthy diet can do wonders and most diets usually include fruit, vegetables or milk. Smoothies are a great alternative to milk and besides the fact that they taste great, they also add natural vitamins and nutrients to your diet. You can even make different kinds of smoothies by mixing fruits and vegetables that you like or recommend from a nutritionist.

This means that smoothies have been deemed a very healthy snack that can help you lose weight and improve your overall health. In addition to the innumerable benefits listed above, there are far more benefits to be had as well. So if you haven't already incorporated smoothies into your diet, it might be time for you to make the plunge.

## Pre-workout Supplements

Pre-workout supplements are a great way to increase your energy and performance during training. They contain a mix of different ingredients that will result in increased strength, increased endurance, and more.

Most people aren't aware of the ingredients that go into these supplements and what exactly they are for. However, if you are in your fitness journey for the long term, it’s time to get acquainted with the key ingredients in your pre-workout supplement. Knowing more about the right ingredients that make up your pre-workout helps you make a better informed decision when choosing the best pre-workout for you. Here are five of the most crucial ingredients that you need to look out for:

### Caffeine

Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant. Caffeine can improve reaction time and your attention span.

The amount of caffeine needed for the benefits to occur is 100mg. This is about 1-2 cups of coffee, or 2-4 cups of tea. If you're going to take a pre-workout supplement containing caffeine, be sure it contains [100mg per serving](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2854104/).

Caffeine is also effective with athletic performance which is why it is one of the primary ingredients in pre-workouts. It is an effective ergogenic aid, which means it improves physical performance. It can also improve cognitive function, endurance, and mood.

### Creatine Monohydrate

Creatine Monohydrate is a supplement that enhances the body's ability to regenerate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and exhibits strong anti-fatigue effects. [Studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14636102/) show that taking creatine can increase your strength by as much as 8%. Creatine Monohydrate is something you want to make sure you have in your pre-workout supplement if you are looking to get those gains from strength training.

### Beta Alanine

Beta Alanine is a supplement that has been used in bodybuilding for years. It’s main purpose is to buffer lactic acid and limit muscle injury. The lactic acid build up during intense exercise can cause you to stop working out – and that’s where beta alanine comes in handy.

This supplement is also good at fighting fatigue and increasing the amount of time it takes for muscles to reach fatigue (i.e., it delays the onset and prolongs the duration of muscular fatigue). As a general rule, those who have [lower amounts of this amino acid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6376352/) will experience more muscular fatigue than those who have higher levels within their bodies.

### Citrulline Malate

Citrulline Malate is a chemical compound that produces energy for the body. It is found in the mitochondria of cells and it performs two important functions. Firstly, Citrulline Malate helps to transport ammonia from the blood to the liver for conversion into urea. Secondly, it acts as an [ATP regenerator](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12145119/) in muscle cells.

Citrulline Malate is able to build up levels of ATP more quickly than any other amino acid, including arginine. This means that Citrulline Malate can generate more energy for your body with less fatigue or soreness during exercise. Many people have been using it in their pre workout supplements because of these benefits. But if you are looking for a high-quality supplement, always make sure the ingredients are safe and effective.

### Taurine

Taurine is an amino acid that can be found in vegetables, seafood, dairy products, and meat. It's one of the most abundant amino acids in the human body. Taurine helps to maintain healthy liver function and regulates hormones.

People who are looking for a pre-workout supplement may want to consider including Taurine in their supplement regimen because it has been shown to [increase performance](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19423840/). This amino acid is crucial to enhance mental clarity, improve muscle recovery, and reduce fatigue during workouts. Taurine also helps with exercise performance by increasing energy production and reducing pain after workout.

It can be found naturally in protein-rich foods like red meat, eggs, dairy products, and fish. But your pre-workout supplement should contain it as well!

### Protein Water

Protein water is a beverage containing between [15 grams to 20 grams](https://www.webmd.com/diet/what-to-know-protein-water#1) of protein per serving. It can be combined with other ingredients to create a complete beverage.

Protein water is a combination of water and protein powder. It has very little taste and can be used as a meal replacement or post-workout drink.

Protein water can be made using either whey protein or plant-based protein powders. The best protein powder for water will depend on your personal preferences and what you are looking for from the product.

It is packed with many health benefits, and here are three of them:

### Protein Water Helps You Lose Weight

Drinking protein-enhanced water, such as [VPA](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/protein-water)® Protein Water, is a great way to increase your intake of high-quality nutrients and vitamins. The drink contains a mix of electrolytes, antioxidants, and other nutrients. Most importantly, it contains protein which can help you stay hydrated.

The best types of protein to use are whey or soy-based proteins because these have been shown to produce more weight-loss results than milk-based proteins. In addition, you should drink the protein water before a meal so that it fills up your stomach and prevents overeating.

Protein Water is a magic bullet for weight loss that is gaining popularity these days.

It contains high-quality protein, fiber, and essential Amino Acids, which are essential for muscle recovery. All these combined work towards your weight loss goal by providing healthy energy.

### Good Source Of Protein

Protein water is high in protein, but it may not have the necessary amount of protein to fully meet your needs for an entire day. Protein water can be used to supplement your regular diet of food and drinks with high amounts of protein.

Protein water is an excellent alternative to protein shakes, especially if you're not into the thick dairy-based protein drinks. Protein water, on the other hand, is just like regular water with additional protein. This is also good for people who have no time to prepare their protein smoothies. Not much preparation is needed. You just grab it and go!

### Gives You Energy

The use of protein water as a beverage has been increasing over the past few years due to people looking for ways to increase their daily intake of proteins without having to have meat or dairy, which can have adverse effects on their health.

Protein water provides an alternative way for those who want the benefits of an increased protein intake. When you drink protein water, your body breaks down the protein and uses it as a source of energy, which results in less sugar being converted into fat cells.

Here are other benefits of protein water:

1. Helps with detoxification and digestion – Protein helps the body break down food into nutrients that can be used by cells. The liver uses amino acids to produce bile acids, which aid in digestion by breaking down fats and oils so they can be absorbed into the bloodstream.
2. It helps build lean muscle mass
3. Drinking protein water may aid in digestion because it has fewer toxins than regular tap water does. Protein water aids in digestion and absorption of nutrients from food by boosting glutathione production and liver function, which leads to better fat burning, healthier skin, and better moods.
4. It's easy to make at home — just mix one scoop of protein ...

# Sweating When Exercising: Myths and Facts

When it comes to sweating when exercising, there are a few myths and misunderstandings to be aware of.

---

## Content

### When it comes to sweating when exercising, there are a few myths and misunderstandings to be aware of:

---

#### Myth #1: "If I work out a lot, I'll lose weight."

Fact: I suppose this is true in part. However, the weight you lose is water weight, not fat weight, and it will be restored when you rehydrate.

---

#### Myth #2: "If I sweat a lot, that implies I'm not fit."

Fact: Sweating is a method to thermoregulate (i.e. regulate your body temperature). Some individuals are more effective than others at dispersing body heat, which is NOT related to fitness levels.

When you exercise, your body generates heat (when muscles contract, the fibres glide over one another, causing friction), and there are four ways to release this heat. Radiation, convection, conduction, and evaporation are all examples of heat transfer. Sweating is classified as evaporation. However, if it is dripping off you, it is not evaporating and therefore is not helping you cool down. You will benefit from adding some convection (movement of air) through a fan to assist this along since when airflow is introduced to a wet body, and it cools quicker than when it is added to a dry body.

---

#### Myth #3: "If you're not sweating when exercising, you're not working hard enough."

Fact: This is also false. Myth 2's explanation is the same.

Your body loses up to 1.5 litres of water each day and much more during intense activity in a hot climate. Aim for 8 cups or 2 litres of water each day (more if you exercise) to stay hydrated.

---

**Important note:** Fluid intake may also occur while eating foods containing water, such as fruits and vegetables, which adds to your daily need.

## R U OK Day

![R U OK Day, Ask them today. September 9 2021. VPA Australia](https://i.shgcdn.com/716343f8-9a33-4521-867a-fa0efd6a4e8b/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

"R U OK day" takes place on the 9th of September every year and is aimed at empowering individuals to ask, listen and support friends or family who may be dealing with depression, anxiety or other mental stressors that can impact a person’s wellbeing. [Ruokay.org.au](https://www.ruok.org.au/) outlines 4 main steps to ask if these important people in your life "Are they really ok?"

1. Ask them R U OK?
2. Listen to their response
3. Encourage action in the form of seeking support, developing good nutritional habits or being more physically active! It may mean simply taking them for a walk to get things off their chest.
4. Check in more regularly! It isn’t just important to ask once off, continue the conversation regularly to ensure you give them a platform to discuss what they may have been dealing with.

## 1. Ask

According to the [Australian Bureau of Statistics](https://www.abs.gov.au/), around 20% of Australians had a mental health condition as of 2018, of which this increased from 18% in 2014-2015. 3.2 million Australians are dealing with anxiety and 1 in 10 individuals experience depression, surprisingly for some the highest risk of mental health conditions seen among women aged 15-24 where there is a prevalence of 30% among this age bracket and gender.

Mental health issues don’t discriminate, just like COVID-19 anyone and everyone can be influenced. Some more than others, however it is important to start the conversation with your close mates and family so that we can get through this tough situation together.

## 2. Listen & Encourage Actions

Exercise between two individuals, wearing masks and socially distanced 1.5 meters is an acceptable means to meet with another individual in the 5km radius of your local government area. If you know of any friends or family within this radius give them a call and ask them if they are okay. Take action by scheduling a short walk to enable them the opportunity to speak about their feelings. Exercise is a fantastic opportunity to not only get some fresh air, sunshine and socialize but also the opportunity to improve your physical wellbeing. There is a plethora of research out there that highlights the role of exercise in combatting depression or anxiety and improving cognitive function and motor learning. All it takes is 30 minutes every day to notice many of these health benefits.

Exercise improves mental health reducing anxiety, depression and negative mood by improving self-esteem and cognitive function. Thirty minutes, three days a week is all that is needed to notice many of these health benefits and it doesn’t have to be continuous only three blocks of 10 minute walks each day produces can be equally effective. The benefits of exercise should be reinforced by every mental health professional for their patients including things like improved sleep quality, increased interest in sex, better endurance, energy and stamina, stress relief, improved mood, weight reduction and reduced blood markers for cholesterol and cardiovascular fitness.

## 3. Check In

### How to Support Someone Going Through Silent Battles

How do we know if someone is going through silent battles that we don't know anything about? How do we know if they are struggling with themselves? While the easy way is to simply ask them, others may not be so keen on opening up as for the fear of being considered weak, imperfect, and a burden. No one wants to feel this way, so people would rather hide behind a smile, even crack a few jokes to conceal the bigger problems that lie within and convince themselves that they are okay, even when they're not.

In this day and age, with everything that has been going on and most especially with COVID-19, everyone is dealing with different personal issues, stress, and anxiety from the many changes in society. Be compassionate towards your loved ones, friends, and family who have felt a bit distant and reach out to them for you never know what one is going through. You wouldn't know unless you ask. Are they really okay?

**There are plenty of ways to reach out and start a tough conversation. Here are a few of our tips:**

#### Encourage them to exercise with you

Asking someone to be your workout partner is a great way to catch up and talk about life. This simple activity even helps that person feel happy because of the endorphins that exercise produces. You are not only promoting physical health, but you can also improve their mental health through working out together.

#### Take Them On A Date

There is no better way to have a good and long conversation than to have a meal right in front of you. Go on a date or even have coffee in a spot you both love. Encourage having a healthy meal since some foods are perfect to boost one's mood. Other foods, like Salmon, are known to be good for mental health.

#### Talk about yourself

Not everyone is willing to talk about themselves and what they have been through. If this is the case, then talk about you. Talk about your own struggles and how you dealt with them. Even when you don't get them to open up, your story will let them know they are not alone.

This is why we encourage you to do more than just ask. Show them that they have someone that they can turn to.

Remember, you don't have to understand what they are going through. You don't have to understand the struggle to make them feel that you care. You just have to be there. Be present. Do more than just asking, "R U okay?"

## Do you want to have a healthy, glowing complexion, stop your skin from looking older and lose weight at the same time? Well, a collagen protein powder might be the answer for you!

Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body, making it a highly sought-after ingredient in cosmetic and weight loss products. Collagen is an essential part of our body because of its countless [benefits](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/five-benefits-of-prebiotic-collagen-protein-to-the-body?_pos=4&_sid=92ecfe8ab&_ss=r).

It helps make up connective tissues like ligaments, tendons, and skin. It also strengthens and helps us recover faster from broken bones. Collagen also plays a role in our digestive health by strengthening mucus lining cells that protect us from pathogens that can cause ulcers or other digestive problems. It has been seen as a weight-loss aid and a beauty enhancer.

These collagen supplements can be found in many different forms, such as collagen powders, collagen bars, collagen drinks and more.

## Is There a Difference Between the Various Types of Collagen Supplements?

To better understand what collagen does, you have to know the different types and uses. There are three sorts of collagen supplements:

### 1) Hydrolysed Collagen:

It is used for joint and bone pain relief. It has been shown in studies to reduce the risk of arthritis by 15-30%. They also [promote weight loss](https://www.furtherfood.com/collagen-for-weight-loss/) as they suppress the hunger hormone ghrelin. An article from [Further Food](https://www.furtherfood.com/collagen-for-weight-loss/) enumerated other ways that collagen can cause weight loss.

### 2) Injectable Collagen:

It is given through an injection to help with conditions such as osteoarthritis, bone fracture repair, and rheumatoid arthritis

### 3) Non-Injectable Collagen:

This type of collagen is taken orally and can help with reducing joint pain and inflammation.

If you are simply looking for one that helps you with weight loss or skin health, a hydrolysed collagen would be your best bet.

## How Can People Consume Collagen Supplements?

Collagen powder can be taken as a supplement or as a food additive. People who do not have a good enough diet or those who work out excessively should be taking collagen supplements daily. It will help them reach their goals of muscle growth and recovery.

Collagen supplements are generally consumed in the form of pills or powders that need to be mixed with water or milk to make them easy to drink for people who don't like taking pills every day. There are also [Collagen supplements](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/collagen-pro) that are almost flavourless, which is great with coffee!

## Does the Amount of Time That a Person Consumes Have an Impact on the Benefits Gained From Consumption?

Yes, it does. The amount of time that you consume collagen protein powder matters. If you consume it for a short period, like two or three weeks, then it might not give you enough benefits to warrant the effort.

Taking collagen supplements plus your body's collagen production would warrant great benefits. You will experience more of its benefits the more you take them.

**SEO Description:** Weight gainers are the most effective way to pack on pounds. They're also a great, convenient way to supplement your diet with the nutrients you need.

## Content

## Most bodybuilders and fitness enthusiasts who are in the market for protein powders are familiar with the term ‘weight gainer’ because of its high-calorie content. However, these products have been reinventing themselves over the years and have become more diverse in health benefits. They are so much more than just supplements that help you with weight gain.

These supplements are meant to be used as a meal replacement rather than a quick fix for your appetite. They are also often used as pre-workout supplements to help fuel muscle growth and endurance. Some companies are developing weight gainers that can be used as post-workout supplements to help provide other nutrition benefits.

Some weight gainers also contain ingredients that can assist with digestion, reduce allergic reactions, increase energy levels, improve sleep quality, reduce anxiety levels, improved mood states and general cognitive function. Learn more about these mass gainers and what they can do for your body.

## What is a Weight Gainer and How Does it Work?
[Weight Gainers](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/supplements/what-is-mass-gainer-and-should-i-use-it?_pos=1&_sid=b6793759c&_ss=r) are some of the most popular protein powders on the market. They are supplements with a high volume of carbohydrates and protein. Incorporating this protein powder into your diet gets enough protein in your body which helps you gain muscle mass. Its primary purpose is to provide a significant amount of protein in a convenient drinkable form.

If you are trying to lose fat and gain muscle, weight/mass gainers may not be the best option. [WPC](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/premium-whey-wpc)/[WPI](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder) are better options as they don't have added carbs and are lower in calories. Weight gainers are better suited to people who struggle to put weight on or train hard and don't get enough food to create a calorie surplus or put on muscle mass.

## Ingredients to look for in a weight gainer:

### Whey Protein Concentrate
The reasons for using whey protein concentrate in weight gainer supplements include that it contains more high-quality proteins than other protein sources such as soy, beef, and egg white. Whey protein concentrate also provides a biologically active form of protein which helps with satiety and building muscle mass. It also promotes [quick muscle recovery](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5537849/).

### Dextrose Monohydrate
[Dextrose Monohydrate](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/dextrose-monohydrate) is a type of sugar that has been used to create weight gainer supplements. It is an important ingredient that has been used to increase the size of muscle cells. Bodybuilders often advertise these muscle gainers for their potential to help people build muscles more quickly and without much effort or time commitment. Athletes also use Dextrose Monohydrate for its potential to increase athletic performance, especially in endurance sports like long-distance running and cycling.

### Maltodextrin
[Maltodextrin](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/maltodextrin) has a high glycemic index and gives an energy boost. They also help with digestion and absorption by slowing the [breakdown of food](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/maltodextrin) into sugars and fat, making it easier for your body to use them as energy sources.

**SEO Title:** The Top 5 Health Benefits of CrossFit Training

**SEO Description:** CrossFit is a challenging, high-intensity workout that teaches you how to be resilient. Here are the top five benefits of CrossFit that make it worth the effort!

---

## Excerpt

No excerpt available

---

## Content

## CrossFit Overview

CrossFit was introduced by a man named Greg Glassman in 2000. Since then, the number of people doing CrossFit has tremendously increased, and by 2021, they already have about [15,000 affiliated gyms](https://www.livestrong.com/article/13730816-crossfit-statistics) worldwide.

CrossFit is an intense workout routine that strives to improve physical fitness in all domains. It's not just about working out - it's about life-long health and wellness choices. CrossFit encourages people to adopt healthy lifestyles via physical activity. Here are five benefits that one can get from CrossFit Crossfit.

---

## Gain muscle mass

CrossFit is not just about strength and endurance but also about gaining muscle mass. This is because these workouts are designed to recruit new muscle fibres. Its benefits can be seen through its diverse set of exercises and routines. Since the concept of CrossFit is to lift different levels of weight at various intervals, it helps your muscles adjust to these different levels.

Your muscles gain more mass as you increase the weights that you lift. However, training may not be enough if your goal is hypertrophy or muscle mass gain. The other key factor that contributes to muscle hypertrophy is nutrition and [supplementation](https://www.vpa.com.au).

---

## Improved cardiovascular health

Crossfit has been found effective in improving cardiovascular health because it trains one's body to better aerobic exercise capacity. [Studies](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2165079916685568) showed that CrossFit training has the same effect on a person's cardiovascular health as someone under high-intensity workouts.

It is widely considered an effective heart-healthy workout routine since it can improve cardiovascular conditioning without adding stress or time to everyday life. It increases VO2 max (maximum oxygen uptake) and fatigue resistance while reducing the risk factors for many diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.

---

## Weight loss

CrossFit is a high-intensity, short-duration series of exercises. It has become trendy for many people to do it to shed off their unwanted weight. CrossFit improves your metabolic rate and helps you [burn calories](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/weight-loss-pack?variant=32516090953783) at rapid rates.

Another reason that CrossFit helps people lose weight is that it provides various options for working out. You can choose from a workout that is suited for your fitness level and goals to achieve the desired look. This allows you to exercise in such a way that is hard to break, which ultimately leads to weight loss goals.

---

## Strength and power development

Crossfit is a type of training that is done in circuit form and combines weightlifting, gymnastics, and cardio exercises into one routine. This makes it good for strength and power development since it builds muscles, increases fitness levels, and improves cardiovascular health.

It helps you develop explosiveness, which improves the power of your lifts in the weight room. It also increases your maximal strength, which will improve both weight room performance and athletic performance.

---

## Makes workout enjoyable

One of the most enjoyable workouts is Crossfit. It is a fitness style that combines workouts from diverse disciplines. This includes Olympic weightlifting, powerlifting, gymnastics, track and field, strongman, callisthenics and more.

The core concept behind Crossfit is that it allows people to provide their best effort regardless of their level of expertise or athleticism. It can be anything from doing pull-ups or handstands to doing kettlebell swings in front of an audience.

---

Crossfit has evolved with different types of workouts being utilized for many other purposes. It is a fun sport because of its variation in activities. It does not have a set routine with the same type of exercises over and over again.

Crossfit is the perfect workout for people who are looking for a challenging, varied, and fun exercise. It's also great for people with an active lifestyle, athletes, or anyone who wants to lose weight or improve their overall fitness levels. Crossfit is more than just a workout. This type of fitness feels like a lifestyle, and it can be one that you enjoy for years to come.

# Strength Training Considerations

When working towards your strength or resistance training goals, the training volume you are completing, force production and recovery between sets are important considerations along with the rest between sets.

---

## Content

---

When was the last time you set the stopwatch and timed the duration of time your set lasted for? The duration of your rest periods between sets or the time it took for you to recover from your training sessions. Appropriately timed rest and sets can tell us a great deal about our recovery, training status and the intensity of the exercise we are performing.

---

When working towards your strength or resistance training goals, the training volume you are completing, force production and recovery between sets are important considerations and the rest between sets. When you rest between sets, this serves the importance of allowing anaerobic energy systems time to recover, allows you to reintroduce the stimulus with good technique. Depending on your training goals, you can shorten the rest period to increase the physical demand on the body. However, if you are looking to develop absolute strength, longer rest periods are crucial for the complete regeneration of Adenosine Tri-Phosphate (ATP) for short term energy production.

---

Regardless, timing your workouts is an effective way to track and standardise the amount of time spent resting between sets. Suppose you are lifting the same weight with good technique for ten repetitions after 5 minutes rest and two weeks later at 3 minutes rest. In that case, that is a progression in itself that inhibits the ability to quantify progression without monitoring. You may be disheartened by the fact you aren’t noticing results. However, if whatever reason, you were in a rush or resting less than normal but failed to monitor this, it can cause reduced motivation. It is similar to an individual consistently checking the scales but failing to recognise the changes in their blood markers or waist circumference with consistent adherence to a physical activity program.

---

Repetitions performed with each set is a prescriptive parameter that is historically used to determine the duration of the set. However, another potential option you might like to consider is time under tension (TUT). This refers to the amount of time that a muscle or group of muscles is under stress for long periods of time when lifting, generally speaking, longer periods of time (40-60 seconds) under tension are associated with increased muscle [hypertrophy](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/muscle-hypertrophy)! So if your goal of training is to develop muscle, then TUT may be another reason for you to consider timing your sets, not only your rest periods between sets.

---

Furthermore, it is also worth considering longer-term recovery rather than the acute phases in and between working sets. Optimal adaptations in strength, muscle hypertrophy and performance are achieved with 48-72 hours recovery. This will be influenced by other factors such as individual fitness and training status. A worthwhile consideration when it comes to the periodisation of your training towards specific goals.

---

If you are struggling to plan your workout or training regime effectively or are worried about whether a particular exercise is suitable for you, reach out to a Professional Exercise Physiologist. They are University Qualified Allied Health Professionals that prescribe exercise to apparently healthy and chronically diseased populations to manage, treat, or prevent chronic disease. They will no doubt be able to help you effectively time and periodise your training!

**SEO Description:** Who says you can't stay active while on a zoom meeting? We beg to differ! Here are ways that you can exercise during these meetings. Your coworkers will never know!

## Content

### Is it even possible to exercise while you're on a zoom meeting- much less have your boss and coworkers not noticing? Our short answer is YES!

Sitting for long periods may seem like a harmless activity, but it's more detrimental than you think. Experts have linked a person's sedentary lifestyle to multiple health issues. The percentage of inactive Australians is more than 55%, where inactive means not meeting the daily requirement based on the physical activity guidelines.

Now that more people are adapting the work from the home structure and zoom meetings are at an all-time high, here are five ways to stay active while facing your boss and coworkers without them even knowing.

---

## Rotate your ankles

According to University Orthopedics, this is how you properly rotate your ankles:

"Raise your foot about 20 inches off the floor. Then, with your toes pointed upward, spin your foot to the left and then back to the right. Hold for at least ten seconds before returning to the starting position. Repeat 20 times for each leg." You can do this [three times a day](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/ankle-sprain-exercises#:~:text=Move%20your%20ankle%20in%20circles,to%20point%20to%20your%20face.).

Sitting for an extended period is not only bad for your back, but it can also cause you to lose circulation in your legs and feet. We should rotate our ankles when we are sitting down because it helps to circulate blood flow in our legs and keeps our ankles healthy. It is best to do this exercise as soon as possible before they start feeling stiff.

---

## Do clenches

Clenching your bottoms is done by squeezing them together and then releasing them.

The pelvic floor muscles, also known as the PC muscles or butt clenches, support the pelvic organs and help control bladder and bowel function.

Exercises for the pelvic floor can be done practically anywhere and at any time. There is no need to invest in any equipment. All you need to do is just learn how to contract and release your PC muscles and then practice until you can do it effortlessly without thinking about it.

---

## Lift your legs

Try these two exercises that you can do while sitting down:

First, you need to sit upright with your back at a 90-degree angle. Take strength from your things as you:

1) Lift one leg up then switch sides;
2) Lift both legs at the same time, then switch sides.

You can do [three sets of 10 reps](https://www.coachmag.co.uk/exercises/abs-workout/172/instant-six-pack-fix-bench-leg-raises#:~:text=Shoot%20for%20three%20sets%20of,right%20angles%20when%20you%20lift.). The act of lifting your legs while sitting down can help to relieve any pressure on your spinal cord and your hips. It also helps with increasing circulation in the pelvic area.

---

## Sit on a yoga or exercise ball.

Exercise yoga balls are a great way to stay active and work on your core muscles. They're also portable so that they can be taken anywhere.

Sitting on an exercise ball helps you develop stronger core muscles because it keeps you moving throughout the day. It's also good for your posture because it keeps the spine straight and reduces pressure on weight-bearing joints like knees and hips.

---

## Tone your calf muscles

A way to tone your calf muscles is through seated calf raises. To do this, you need to sit properly on a chair with your knees at a 90-degree angle. You then put your body weight into your thighs and raise your toes.

You hold this position for a couple of seconds and slowly put your toes back on the ground. You repeat this a couple of times.

It may seem like a small thing at first glance, but doing short bursts of exercise throughout the day can be extremely helpful for your health. You can do all the activities mentioned above without your boss or coworkers knowing.

If you are unable to, you can also start by taking a break for at least five minutes every hour to walk around or stretch - it will help you stay active and healthy!

### Many people are now looking for a healthier and lighter-weight alternative to sugar for their favourite foods and drinks, which their research might lead to Maltodextrin. But what is Maltodextrin, and is it safe?

Maltodextrin is a carbohydrate used as a food additive. It is often included in sports and energy drinks as a cheaper and easily digestible alternative to sugar.

Learn more about what Maltodextrin is, its benefits, the side effects when taken in high amounts, and how it can improve your performance! Read on.

---

## What are the Benefits of Using Maltodextrin as a Sports Performance Carb Source?

Ordinary people have been taking Maltodextrin without even recognizing that it's part of their daily diet. They are not aware of their benefits, but athletes and gym-goers have been aware of what it can provide. They know that they get a lot of benefits from it.

Here are a couple of advantages that one can get from the correct intake of this supplement:

---

### Great source of fuel for athletes

Maltodextrin is a great source of fuel for athletes because it can be quickly broken down in the intestine and absorbed by the body without digested, giving an athlete fuel and energy when they need it. The best thing about Maltodextrin is that it provides the body with energy without any fat or cholesterol.

---

### High Glycemic Index

Glycemic index is a measure of how quickly a food causes a rise in blood sugar levels. Foods with a high glycemic index cause a rapid and large increase in blood sugar, while foods with a low glycemic index cause only a small and gradual increase in blood sugar.

It is good that Maltodextrin has a high glycemic index because it helps to increase energy levels and maintain stable blood glucose levels when taken incorrectly.

---

### Flavourless

Maltodextrin is flavourless. This means that it can be used in a range of foods and drinks. It's perfect for anything as you would hardly know it's there.

---

### Help athletes feel full faster

When you consume Maltodextrin with water or milk, Maltodextrin will make you feel full and satisfied with less volume of food in your stomach. The benefit of this product is that athletes can eat less and still feel like they had a substantial meal that will keep them going for hours on end.

Please take note that not all Maltodextrin supplements are made equally, so it's always best to go with a trusted brand. Here are other benefits that you can get from [VPA® Maltodextrin](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/maltodextrin?variant=32044875546679):

## GABA Benefits

You have heard of GABA, but are you aware of its benefits? Do you know how much it influences your health and mental state? Read through and discover the top five benefits of Gamma- Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) to the body and brain. First, you need to understand what GABA is.

GABA is an abundant inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. GABAergic synapses are responsible for regulating neuronal excitability and maintaining homeostasis.

Neurotransmitters are chemicals that can carry signals from one neuron to another neuron or other types of cells. They work by binding to receptors which are docking points for these chemicals on the surface of neurons.

Here is a rundown of the benefits of taking GABA supplements:

## GABA Helps with Anxiety-related Disorders

GABA is responsible for slowing down neurons' activity and reducing their excitability. In other words, it helps calm down our brains.

When GABA levels are too low, people may experience several different symptoms such as anxiety, irritability, insomnia and even seizures. One way to promote a healthy level of GABA is through a diet that includes a variety of foods containing the amino acid L-Tryptophan, which converts into 5HTP, which converts into serotonin, which then converts into GABA.

Simply put, eat more [foods containing gamma and high levels of L-Tryptophan](https://www.myfooddata.com/articles/high-tryptophan-foods.php) like milk, lean turkey and chicken, beef, oatmeal and more.

## GABA helps stabilise mood

A stable mood is essential for mental health and overall wellbeing. It helps to make better decisions, and it makes you more productive. People who feel less happy or content with their life are more likely to experience mental health problems like depression, anxiety, and addiction.

GABA is responsible for [regulating neuronal excitability](https://www.nature.com/articles/4001021#:~:text=Mood%2Dstabilizing%20anticonvulsant%20medications%20raise,regulation%20in%20multiple%20cortical%20regions.). This function is crucial for mood maintenance and balance. For those who suffer from anxiety or stress, it can be helpful to take GABA. Many GABA-rich foods are some of the best mood stabilisers because they promote a sense of calm and relaxation while not causing lethargy.

## GABA helps manage Blood Pressure

Low blood pressure is essential for a healthy lifestyle because it helps to prevent cardiovascular disease. There are a lot of effects of GABA, and one of those is to help [lower blood pressure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4613098/#:~:text=Central%20GABA%20can%20decrease%20blood,to%20maintain%20normal%20blood%20pressure.) levels.

The study showed that GABA inhibits the release of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate and aspartate. This helps relax the muscles and calm the mind, resulting in lowered blood pressure levels.

## GABA Benefits Mental Clarity and Performance

The neurotransmitter GABA is an inhibitory one that balances the brain's excitatory system. It helps promote mental clarity and boosts performance in some cases. A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep12770) in 2015 showed that people who took 800 mg of GABA daily were able to prioritise their tasks more.

## GABA Improves Sleep Quality And Protects The Nervous System From Damage Due To Aging And Diseases

GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. If there is an excess of this neurotransmitter, then it can cause anxiety, and because of that, people with anxiety tend to have trouble sleeping.

GABA helps to create a calming atmosphere in the brain, so it can [improve sleep quality](https://www.objectivewellness.com/journal/posts/meet-gaba-your-new-best-friend-for-falling-asleep#:~:text=By%20inhibiting%20neural%20activity%2C%20GABA,associated%20concerns%2C%20like%20difficulty%20sleeping.) for those who struggle with anxiety. It not only helps you sleep, but it also protects your brain. The levels of GABA in the brain are linked to the number of neurotransmitters the brain is releasing. One of its functions is protecting neurons from damage due to aging and diseases.

# Mental Health Month - October

This mental health month in October, VPA wants to spread the message of how important physical activity is, not just for a strong body but also for a strong mind.

---

## Content

---
We live in an era where the demands placed upon us by work, social, or personal commitments often lead to very busy and stressful lives, which often coincides with poor lifestyle decisions or choices. Metabolic syndrome is exponentially increasing, and lifestyle interventions like regular physical activity are a small-time commitment and low-cost alternative to developing these health complications. However, we often forget about the role of physical activity and exercise in the management of mental illnesses like anxiety or depression. Callaghan et al. (2006) even suggest this sad fact with research into the neglect of physical activity in the treatment of mental health amongst patients.

In October, this mental health month, VPA® wants to spread the message of how important physical activity is, not just for a strong body but also for a strong mind. We have all felt the impacts of extended lockdowns in one way or another, and with the doors to gyms swinging open this month, there is no better time to start the discussion about moving more and its benefits for our mental wellbeing.

Here are our top 5 Tips & benefits of regular physical activity for mental health:

- Aerobic exercise like swimming, cycling, running or jogging has been shown to reduce the symptoms of anxiety and depression significantly. Improved circulation and blood flow to the brain and involvement of the HPA Axis impact our stress reaction. The HPA axis communicates directly with different brain components, controlling mood and motivation amongst other physiological processes.

- Regular exercise like resistance or strength-based activities is an important booster for self-esteem and cognitive function. Exercise serves as an important treatment for patients with Schizophrenia in alleviating symptoms of obesity associated with increased adiposity around the waste associated with the use of antipsychotic medications. In a study conducted across 12 weeks, patients living with Schizophrenia saw improvements in overall fitness and health, including blood pressure, energy levels and grip strength!

- The research shows that we should be shooting for even as little as 3 x 30-minute brisk walks each week to see improvements in our ability to manage our mental wellness. Good news for those who struggle to find the time to exercise, you can break these 30 minutes into multiple blocks of 10 minutes if you’re are short on time – all in similar all-seeing benefits regardless!

- Mental health service providers can provide evidence-backed and effective treatment for the management of mental illness, including psychopharmacology, psychotherapy, and exercise physiology!

- Each year, individuals diagnosed with anxiety, depression, or other mental health illnesses have access to 5 subsidised consults through medicating with allied health professionals. Aside from this, remember to reach out to friends or family if you are struggling. The following helplines are also always there to provide assistance:
  - Lifeline: 13 11 14
  - Beyond Blue: 1300 22 4636

**SEO Description:** It happens to all of us: we eat a meal and then we crave sweets. What's going on, and how can you control it? Read on and find out why you love having desserts!

### We've all been there
We've all been there. You finish a delicious meal, and suddenly all you can think of is sweets. And then the guilt sets in after a few seconds because you just ate a slice of pie or a piece of cake.

You might have wondered why that is. Let us explain:

### What is the Science Behind Sweet Cravings After Eating?
There is no denying that sweets make us feel happy and satisfied. But why do we feel this way after eating? Because we want more of that "happy" feeling.

After eating, our body releases endorphins, which are natural morphine-like substances that act as natural painkillers to suppress feelings of stress, sadness, or anxiety. That's what we want more of.

Understanding your brain's response to sugar is the key to finding out how to stop craving it.
What is it about sugar that makes us crave it? It's not just the taste but also how our brains respond. We usually get a surge of dopamine in response to sugar release, which feels good and makes us want more.

One way to understand this phenomenon is through the "sweet tooth" hypothesis, which suggests that sweet foods cause our bodies to release glucose into our bloodstreams. As a result, we get a surge of happy hormones that make us feel great and want more of them again.

### Imbalance in Blood Glucose Level
It can also be due to an [imbalance in blood glucose level](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/explaining-the-siren-song-of-sugar-and-how-to-beat-the-habit/2018/01/26/8a9557f8-f7ae-11e7-a9e3-ab18ce41436a_story.html#:~:text=Many%20sugar%20cravings%20stem%20from,it%20and%20increase%20your%20energy.). If it's too low even after eating, your body will crave sugar to make your blood glucose level rise.

With that, here are five tips to help you curb the craving for sweets after eating:

### Top 5 Tips to Help You Curb your sweet Cravings
There are many ways to curb your sweet cravings. The most important thing in overcoming the craving is to take control of your emotions and to focus on where you can control what.

1. Accept that it's just not possible to stop craving sweets for good. Instead, get started to reduce the number of times you crave them by 25% each day.
2. Keep track of how often you crave sweets - keep a journal to monitor your food intake and see if it correlates with when you crave sweets more frequently. If so, try making healthier choices that align with when you don't crave them more often - grabbing a fruit instead on a slice of cake, having grilled chicken instead of fried chicken, etc.
3. Avoid a sweet snack before a meal - It triggers the appetite, and you end up eating more of it.
4. Alternate between fruit and non-sweet foods - This will keep the taste of sweetness from sticking around in your mouth too long, which will make it easier to resist going for more sweets later at the office or when you're out with friends.
5. Chew gum or drink water - Simply chewing gum or drinking water can help release some of the sugar in your mouth so that when you reach for an unhealthy snack, later, there's not as much in your mouth to be tempted by.

Certain things are just normal, like food cravings. This is especially true when it comes to sweets. Food cravings are not the only thing that can lead to obesity.

We all deserve a little treat now and then, but it is essential not to go overboard. Too much of anything might be bad for our health in the long run. So, try to eat sweets in moderation. There is nothing wrong with having a sugar craving once in a while - as long as you know how to deal with it properly!

## Choosing the Right Footwear for Training

There are plenty of different types of footwear you can use for training, but how can you tell which one to use, and which one is right for you?

### Gyms Reopening in Australia

Gyms are beginning to open their doors once again in some areas across Australia! What an exciting time. The hype is real, and everyone is getting excited after spending such a long time stuck in lockdown.

And whilst everyone knows what their favourite singlet and protein shaker is, training shoes however are a bit more confusing, or even left as an afterthought. Does your choice of footwear affect your performance? There are plenty of different types of footwear you can use for training, but how can you tell which one to use, and which one is right for you?

Let’s get on top it and get the right pair of kicks, before all gyms open back up across Australia.

Here’s a breakdown:

1. **Weightlifting Shoes**: These are the types of shoes that have the massive, heavy heel to them. Often quite bulky, and it seems like only the absolute weapons in the gym have a pair? A weightlifting shoe is ideal for someone that trains Olympic lifting, or any sort of squat pattern. By having a raised heel, this allows you to hit a deeper squat position by artificially improving the range of dorsiflexion in the ankle. Basically, your ankles don’t have to move as far, so your hips and knees take care of the work. Hitting a deep position is ideal for getting under a heavy snatch or clean, but these are often quite pricey. Definitely worth the investment if you’re a regular lifter.

2. **Cross Training Shoes**: Cross Training shoes are more common. These are your Nike Metcons and your Reebok Nanos. These shoes are designed to be a lot more versatile, but also have a flat heel and base. Ideal for doing a large variety of different movements, due to the added stability from the flat base. However, there are some limitations. Running in a shoe like this is not ideal as they are often quite rigid.

3. **Running Shoes**: We’ve gone from extremely rigid and stable, to completely spongy and soft. Running shoes are heavily padded, as they are ideal for force absorption. Sports, events or exercises that involve a high volume of reps, then this is your shoe. These shoes are designed to help you take force over prolonged periods time, hence why they are used by endurance-based athletes. Whilst lifting in running shoes is still possible, the spongy sole does not provide the stability required for heavy resistance.

The sport/training style you do most should dictate the type of shoe that is ideal for you. However, if you’re just an all-rounder and have the budget, buying both a running and cross trainer shoe will go a long way.

### Many outdoor activities can help you maintain your fitness during Spring

Spring is the perfect time for outdoor fitness activities because you can feel the fresh air and enjoy nature without feeling too hot or too cold. Moreover, it has beautiful flowers that are in full bloom.

The beauty of Spring should inspire you to get up and get moving! If you have no idea where to start, you can try these activities out:

---

#### Swimming

Spring is an excellent time to go for a swim. It is a good exercise that both kids and adults can enjoy.

It is also great for fitness as It is a low-impact cardio workout, which means it won't strain your joints and provide ample energy while you swim. It is safe for anyone to take up, no matter their age or fitness level.

![Swimming](https://i.shgcdn.com/f0a9ebc8-cfd2-4a0c-a6f0-8e6451af8d91/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

---

#### Hiking

Another great outdoor activity for Spring is hiking. You can go for long walks without the heat of summer. Since hiking or trekking is an active form of exercise, you can burn more calories by doing this activity.

This is also the reason that you have to be mindful of your hydration. Staying hydrated is crucial, and if you want to stay hydrated and also get more protein, try our [protein water](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/protein-water).

---

#### Running through a park or a new location

Running through a park or a new location is a good workout during Spring. There are a lot of benefits in trying out other places than your usual route. This would not only help you explore more places, but it is also a good cardio workout.

You can also be strategic in choosing the location during your run. If you're training for a marathon, running on the beach would allow your muscles to fatigue faster while still providing stability and balance.

![Running](https://i.shgcdn.com/c65af9a6-8cda-4c84-94e1-22a6599c298c/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

---

#### Walking

The weather is warmer, but that does not mean you shouldn't try to get in a workout. Walking around your local park or in a new city can be an excellent way to break up the monotony. Even if you are in an area with little to no nature, you can still walk through the city and get in a good workout.

Instead of following someone else's route, map out your own path or keep track of how many kilometers you've walked. It will be more manageable and enjoyable if it's planned.

It is also an opportunity to clear your mind and take in the scenery. Since the human body needs physical movement to stay healthy and strong, walking is a great way to make sure you stay healthy this Spring.

---

#### Cycling

Cycling is a great alternative to routine exercise during Spring. Many health benefits come with cycling, such as improved cardiovascular function, increased muscle strength and endurance, lower body weight, and reduced risk for obesity.

Cycling can be done any time of the year, but it is best in the Spring when there is less rainfall. Spring is the perfect time for people to get outdoors and enjoy the beauty that nature has to offer. Spring also brings warmer weather, which can make outdoor activities like cycling more enjoyable.

---

#### Stand Up Paddle Boarding

SUP is an excellent sport for people who want to work on their balance, coordination and overall fitness. It also helps with mental health and relieves stress.

It is low impact, making it great for people who suffer from joint strain or arthritis; it can help improve posture, and it is low-cost.

It is a great exercise for any level of fitness. This activity is also great for couples who are looking for some bonding time on the water.

![Stand Up Paddle Boarding](https://i.shgcdn.com/47ea346d-b07a-4094-a16a-2377df6bd90e/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

---

Spring is the perfect time for outdoor fitness activities. It is a beautiful season in many ways, but it excels at outdoor fitness activities. These activities are not just an opportunity for exercising but also something that can bring people closer together.

**SEO Description:** When you join a running club or Parkrun, you get a chance to meet others who want to run and share the love for this sport. Here's how it can benefit your health:

The benefits of running clubs are plenty, but one of the most important is that it can help you improve your physical and [mental health](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/how-exercise-can-improve-mental-health-exercise-for-your-wellbeing). When you start a park run, there are no judgmental eyes on you or your pace, which can be helpful for people who are nervous about their running abilities.

Joining a running club is perfect for beginners looking to have some fun with it - making new friends will always help with motivation. Here are five more benefits that you can get when you join a running club or park run.

## #1 - The Fun Factor

One of the main benefits of joining a running club is the fun that it brings. You get to meet new people and can even start up conversations with them. Being part of a club means you'll never have to run alone again.

Nothing beats a good morning run during spring, especially if you do it with people that inspire you.

## #2 - Get Inspired to Keep Going

Joining a running club or park run would be the perfect way to restart your exercise regime as well as meeting new people. Springtime can be so inspiring, especially for those stuck in the same routine throughout the winter months.

Joining a running club this season would not only give you something new to focus on, but it will also give you amazing company and motivate you to keep going. If you see other club members pushing themselves, this will inspire you to do the same.

## #3- Socialize with Others in Your Community

Spring is the perfect time to get in shape and meet new people in your community. Running clubs or park runs help you socialize with others. It doesn't matter if you are new to running. You can still join a running club and become part of a great team.

Running clubs and park runs offer a way for people to get to know each other while also staying fit and healthy. Plus, they're an excellent way for people who enjoy the outdoors and exercise in general to spend time with other like-minded members of their community.

## #4- Boost Your Self-Esteem and Confidence by Seeing Successful Others in Your Group

When we commit to something, we want to ensure that we are putting in the necessary effort required for success. Seeing success on a level of running and exercise is one way to motivate ourselves and help us reach our goals.

This is why many people like joining running clubs in the springtime when park runs take place. When you start this type of club, you can see other people in your area doing this activity, and their successes will help boost your self-esteem and confidence even more.

## #5- Get Support When You Need It Most

It can be easy to feel alone in life. Everyone is always in their own world, and it can be easy to forget that you are not the only one dealing with daily struggles. Feeling lazy instead of exercising is just one of those challenges.

When you join a running club or park run, you meet people who are just like you. They're happy to share their stories about how they managed their own battles with everyday life and how they motivated themselves to keep going. Joining a club allows you to run with people who give you the support that you need.

These are only a few benefits that you get when joining a running club or park run. There are plenty more. Only good things can come from being a member. It's about time that you join one this spring.

## Finding the Best Black Friday Offers

With all the Black Friday noise and promotions, it can be difficult to find what you're looking for and make sure you get the best price. Here are our tips in finding the best offers on Black Friday.

---

## Content

Black Friday deals are trending around the world, and they get more popular every year. With so many big brands, from brick and mortar stores to eCommerce, riding the wave, people are starting to keep an eye out for their favourite things on sale to get the most bang for their buck. It might as well be the perfect way to kickstart the holiday shopping spree and get that home item, toy, or gift idea we've been eyeing on for friends, family, or for ourselves!

With all the Black Friday noise and promotions, it can be difficult to find what you're looking for and make sure you get the best price.

How do you find the best offers on Black Friday? Here are our tips:

### Start early

The best time to start planning is as early as possible. Put together a list of items that you really need or want and take the time to compare offers from the different brands that offer them. Bookmark or keep them on your radar to see if they have any promotions or sales during Black Friday or Cyber Monday.

### Plan ahead

If you plan your shopping in advance, you can avoid overspending and wasting your time. Go straight for what's necessary on your list and maybe chuck in a few treats if you have extra to spend.

### Research for the best stores

Like every big expense, research is key! Check for online reviews to ensure that the items are exactly to your liking and that they have positive feedback from other customers. If Black Friday offers are already posted, remember to take note of their coupons and offer expiry to ensure you get the special offer.

### Choose Online Shopping Over Going to a Physical Store

Online shopping saves time because you don't have to go out on a cold night or walk miles to your favourite store. You can also see your purchase before buying it, which means you are more likely to purchase on impulse rather than just seeing something online and then having buyer's remorse later.

**SEO Title:** Benefits of dynamic stretches or warm-ups before a run

**SEO Description:** Prior to running, it's important to warm up the body. This can be done with dynamic stretching exercises or with a gentle walk.

## Content

We all remember the awkward circle at the beginning of every Phys ed. class where the teacher would stand in the middle, and we would all reluctantly copy them whilst they would bend into odd positions and count aloud for a period of time. Every now and then, someone would let out a "passing of wind" sound where the teacher would turn around sternly, and everyone would be holding in their laughter. Ahh, the good old days of static stretching.

---

You will be glad to know that those days are well and truly behind us (I'm not just talking about the last few years that have crept away on us, thanks Covid!) But welcome to the world of dynamic stretching. As research demonstrates, static stretching may not be as beneficial for us as we once thought and, in some instances, even detrimental to our health (Herman & Smith, 2008).
A dynamic stretch is characterised by vigorous motions that allow joints and muscles to move through their whole range of motion. You will then notice the benefits of dynamic stretching when you Replace static stretching with an active, dynamic stretch that is sport-specific.

![Image](https://i.shgcdn.com/50550c86-791b-4c52-963d-b85f13b31b3b/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

---

This will enable your speed, strength, power, agility, and other essential fitness components to be enhanced. Increasing your core body temperature and blood flow is one of the crucial goals of doing pre-exercise warm-ups. Elevating your body temperature is critical since this causes your blood temperature to rise, allowing more oxygen to reach working muscles.

---

Additionally, raising your body temperature raises the temperature of your muscles, allowing heated muscles to contract more strongly and relax more rapidly. So how long should we be warming up for, you may ask? Arnheim and Prentice (2000) suggest that a warm-up should go no longer than fifteen minutes but at least ten minutes long to have the most effect.

---

It is most beneficial to have the main activity start no later than fifteen minutes after the end of the warm-up. The warm-up can be broken up into two different parts: the sweat part and the skill part. In the "sweat part", you want to use large muscle groups through activities like jogging or biking that will enable the individual to raise their core temperature and metabolic rate.
This will be evident when the participant sweats. The next stage of the warm-up is the "skill part", where individuals use stretching exercises specific to the upcoming sport or activity. For example, someone going to go for a run could use walking lunges, high knees and bum kick stretching exercises to increase the range of motion of their hamstrings and quadriceps. It does not only benefit your lower body but your upper body as well. With its countless advantages, it should be part of your warm-up routine.

With statistics showing that 50% of long-distance runners are likely to have an injury caused by running (YALE Medicine, 2021), you must do everything to minimise the risk. In order to reduce the likelihood of causing injury to yourself, it is vital that you conduct a proper, thorough warm-up prior to beginning your activity, especially running. After all, no one wants to spend their upcoming summer in a cast!

## Moustache Movember

Moustache Movember is an annual event where men grow moustaches to raise awareness for different health issues. Behind this movement is a group of men who push for early cancer detection and diagnosis. They also aim for early treatment that can result in the reduction of untimely deaths among men.

One of the reasons it is so popular is that it does not only focus on [prostate cancer](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/mens-health-movember) but also other health issues that might affect men, including mental health, testicular cancer, and suicide prevention.

Movember strives to create a dialogue around mental health issues that have long been stigmatized or neglected due to a lack of understanding or resources. Movember provides resources for those looking for help and offers education on the prevention of depression and suicide. This year, let’s take a closer look at the mental health issues that men face.

**SEO Description:** VPA Australia is working to become more eco-friendly by employing different initiatives that will help reduce their carbon footprint and make a difference in the world.

## Content

The world is going green and there is a lot that we can do to help the environment in a sustainable way.
Being eco-friendly can assist us in reducing our carbon footprint and making sure that we are not contributing to the depletion of the Earth's resources. We should be thinking of ways to live more sustainably and minimize our impact on the environment.
There are many ways to make sure that we are living in an eco-friendly manner at home, for instance, by recycling, reducing food waste, switching from paper towels to washable towels for wiping water spills, and using less water. We could also do so by being more mindful of what products we support, use, and how they affect the environment.
This is why it's essential to buy from companies that choose to do their part to help. Corporate sustainability is gaining popularity as many companies are promoting eco-friendly practices. Many companies have become more eco-friendly by using paperless services such as e-signatures, e-visas, and e-bills.
We, at VPA®, Australia, are doing our part to help the environment. We understand the importance of being eco-friendly and what it can do for the planet.
Here are the actions that we have implemented:

## VPA® NEW BRISBANE HQ is now 100% solar-powered
Solar power is an important renewable energy resource that can help slow down the depletion of our natural resources.
Solar power uses solar energy to generate electricity by converting sunlight into heat, light, or other forms of radiant energy. Solar power comes from sunlight which is free and abundantly available.

![VPA New HQ in Brisbane is now 100% Solar Powered](https://i.shgcdn.com/60af4a52-8547-4dbb-ba4e-56020f87b4d9/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

We are proud to announce that Our NEW HQ and manufacturing plants in Brisbane is 100% solar-powered. This is our way of ensuring that we cater to our customer's needs without harming the environment.
We will continue our journey in doing what we can to help the environment. Take the journey with us as you support our company and our efforts in maintaining sustainable practices.

## Use of eco-friendly packaging
The most important aspect of eco-friendly packaging is reducing waste and saving natural resources like water and energy. With this, we can create a more sustainable future for our planet.

![Eco-Friendly Packaging](https://i.shgcdn.com/ef7cd6b2-dfe8-4e9c-afb1-15b11a78a20d/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

VPA® Australia has partnered with [Redcycle](https://redcycle.net.au/) to help promote sustainability. Redcycle is an innovative circular economy product that helps to reduce the amount of waste produced by consumers. It aims to make recycling more efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable.
VPA® starch bags are made of 100% biodegradable materials, so they can be tossed in the compost bin or used as animal feed after they have served their purpose.
[We use these starch bags for our packaging](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/news-and-updates/vpa-environment-impact) because they help reduce food waste, which is a significant issue in our society today. They can also help to prevent food spoilage and contamination, which is common when using the plastic packaging that comes with most items.

## Use of CarbonClick
CarbonClick is an innovative platform that helps companies offset their environmental footprint while supporting projects that can make a difference to our planet's sustainability.
The use of CarbonClick promotes carbon-neutral shopping. Carbon neutral is a term used for corporations or entities that have balanced out carbon emissions.
The carbon-neutral shopping movement encourages you to shop from brands and stores that put up efforts to reduce their carbon footprint. Carbon-neutral shopping encourages you to purchase your favourite VPA® products while giving back to environmental projects that matter.
You can get [more information on CarbonClick here](https://www.carbonclick.com/faq/).

# TEN EASY TIPS TO GET THAT BEACH-READY BODY NOW!

We are slowly approaching the days of sun, sand, and, most importantly, summer bodies.  
This means that summer is just around the corner. The sun is shining, the waves are crashing, and you can smell BBQs in the air.

## GET ENOUGH SLEEP
There are many reasons why you might need to get enough sleep to get a summer body. Sleep deprivation can lead to being more prone to diseases, being more stressed, and not being as productive.  
Try these tips for getting enough sleep:
- Create a [bedtime routine](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/sleep-hygiene) to give your body an idea that it is sleeping time
- Avoid screens near your bedtime.
- Keep your bedroom cool and dark, so it's easy for you to fall asleep.

## Eat more vegetables and fruit
Fruits and vegetables are nutritional powerhouses. They are important for your dietary needs. Just eating more of these can make a huge difference in your health.  
You should not be worried about the calorie count. Vegetables are also low in calories but rich in fibre and nutrients that will help you to feel fuller for longer.  
If you want to get that summer body, then eating more vegetables and fruit is the way to go!

## Reduce your sugar intake
We often think that eating sugar is a harmless indulgence. However, this is not entirely true. A cupcake can be harmless, but like anything, sweets need to be taken into moderation. Overloading sugar can cause a range of health issues, from tooth decay to obesity and diabetes.

## Stop eating close to your bedtime
The late-night is a time of day when people are more likely to be either snacking or going to bed with a full stomach. All this indulging in unhealthy foods will cause weight gain and lower your metabolism rate.  
What is considered late-night eating? Study shows that eating [less than two to three hours before bedtime](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/8-secrets-to-a-good-nights-sleep) is considered late-night eating and should be avoided. That's why it's essential for people looking to lose weight and get a summer body to stop eating two hours before going to bed.

## Exercise

It's time to get moving and work towards that beach-ready body!

# Exercise and Immune System

Exercise has long been established as an important adjunct to any dietary, medicinal or other lifestyle interventions against chronic disease, pain or infection. Since the world was sent into snap lockdowns in early 2020 with the severe acute respiratory syndrome known as Coronavirus, how individuals could strengthen their immune system to the potential complications of COVID-19 has become a hot topic.

For the major proportion of the population social distancing, regular handwashing, mask wearing, getting double doses of the vaccine and testing when a known close contact made the most sense. However what other measures like good nutrition, regular physical activity and stress management can play an effective role in maintaining good immune and respiratory health. During and in the hours following a single bout of exercise there is an increase in cell recruitment, the number of circulating pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines and lymphocyte circulation. A secondary review paper published by da Silveira et al. (2020) indicated that such factors influence a lower incidence, mortality rate and reduced intensity of symptoms associated with virally infected individuals.

Typically, COVID-19 is clinically characterised by fever, cough, fatigue, breathlessness, pneumonia, other neurological symptoms, or mortality. The immune dysregulation that occurs with COVID-19 has had fatal outcomes for individuals with other comorbidities or those of old age. If you consider the statistics that in 2019, around 703 million people were over the age of 65 worldwide that put 10% of the world’s population at risk of a negative prognosis related to COVID-19 infection. Therefore, the implementation of physical activity and exercise has been widely prescribed due to its anti-inflammatory properties and its ability to promote healthy ageing reducing all-cause mortality risk.

When it comes to the specific volume of physical activity required to accrue such benefits Colbert et al. (2004) conducted a study with a sample of over 3000 subjects aged between 70-79, those that completed a weekly volume of 180 minutes of walking or other incidental activities per week showed reduced inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein which is made by the liver and secreted into the blood after infection or inflammatory injury. Furthermore, lower levels of Cytokine tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) were also found, a inflammatory cytokine produced during acute inflammation and also involved in resistance to various infections or cancers.

Whilst further investigation and research is required in this area, the available literature suggests that regular physical activity does strengthen the immune system, providing a positive benefit in response to viral communicable infectious diseases. To read more on the topic below references have been listed for further reading.

**SEO Description:** We have tips for you to stay on track with your diet and training! Little tips like these can go a long way and help you reach your fitness goals!

### Any athlete or anyone who has embarked on a fitness journey towards their goals will let you know that it is never an easy feat. Like any new beginnings, starting off enthusiastically lead us the right direction but keeping the same energy towards the end is a challenge.

Staying on track with your diet and training can be overwhelming at times, especially when work and other life events interfere. But we are here to remind you that quitting is never an option! A little organization and tips will help keep that momentum going.

---

#### #1 Meal plan
When meals are not planned and you are pressed for time and on a busy schedule, choosing the right foods to eat is the last thing you will want to stress on. In many cases, this step is sacrificed or taken for granted and is where most people fail when trying to reach their fitness goal.

We suggest creating a [weekly meal plan](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/3-ways-to-meal-prep-and-cut-down-cooking-time) to prepare your week’s healthy meals. Keep in mind to occasionally mix things up- create a variety on the menu. The last thing you’ll want is to get bored with your food and end up ordering food somewhere else.

Planning meals are supposed to save time and money, so make your meals interesting. Need any meal-prep ideas? Check out our [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzdp2CzFf_a4d_xqLnsTG5g?view_as=subscriber) for recipes!

---

#### #2 Grocery Shop
If you are like me, grocery trips and the thought of filling up the pantry with new things is more of a treat than a chore! I am a terrible wanderer and I love to take my time (Horrible, I know). So, writing a meal plan and a shopping list will put your focus on and help keep all the unnecessary junk and extras at bay. This too, will reduce your grocery bill significantly and cut down your usual store trips.

---

Things to add to the cart:
- Pack protein into your meals and snacks.
- Frozen fruits like berries are last longer in the fridge and are easy ingredients to add to anything.
- Boost your fruits and vegetable intake.
- Add in healthy fats, (they are great to snack on) – nuts, seeds, avocados and olive oil

---

#### #3 Pre-prepare the food
Here is the fun part! Meal prepping can easily be a weekend family activity, especially when you are working on big batches. If you are rolling solo, then I would say it is therapeutic when you make time for it. Prepare your meals and cook them according to your menu for the week. Any ingredients that need to be chopped up, stored in containers separately, and to be assembled later should be done and organized at this point.

You will thank yourself further down the week for that smooth and easy grab and go healthy meal.

---

#### #4 Schedule your training
Build a healthy habit of doing your training or exercise for the week in specific schedules, wherever you can fit it in your day. When is the best time for you to squeeze in that workout? Whether it is early in the morning before work or after, make sure it’s something you can easily stick to and keep that discipline.

---

#### #5 Keep track of your progress
Keeping track of your progress is one way to motivate you to keep going. There is nothing like seeing the results to all your hard work. You can easily do so by taking photos of yourself and marking off the days on the calendar like a visual diary. There is nothing like experiencing a motivation high off your own achievements.

Another way to do so is to have company at the gym. Have an accountability gym buddy and keep track of each other’s progress. Establishing great relationships at the gym can help motivate you when you are struggling as it helps to know you’re not alone.

---

#### #6 Get enough sleep
We often get so fixated on getting the work in physically that we forget that sleep is literally at the bedrock of Maslow’s Hierarchy of needs. Sleep is vital for our mental and physical health, yet we easily take it for granted. Coffee in the morning’s great but that feeling after a good night’s sleep is gold. And it also improves your performance during training.

# Exercises to improve muscle synergy, co-ordination and mobility

**SEO Description:** Simple mobility exercises that can be performed with minimal equipment.

Mobility involves specific exercises that will increase your range of motion and your stabilisation, or control of muscles surrounding the joint. Flexibility mainly relates to the amount of range of motion at the joint, whilst mobility relates to the strength throughout that range or the ability of your limbs to move through a range of controlled movements. Mobility aims to prevent injury and improve strength through a specific range of motion

Below are 3 simple mobility exercises that can be performed with minimal equipment.

1. Supine Band Pullovers - In a supine lying position with thera-band tied to pole or sturdy object behind your body, keeping the arms straight grab the band from above the head and pull the arms down keeping the shoulder back and chest out.
2. Inchworms – Bring your hands to the floor keeping your legs straight, walk your body out until you are parallel with the ground. With elbows extended hold for a brief moment before walking the hands back and standing up straight.
3. Frog Pose into Deep Squat – Standing with feet just slightly outside shoulder width, sit back into squat and spread knees apart. Walk your hands forward along the floor in front of you and hold for a second before moving back into the deep squat position.

Muscle synergy involves that muscles rarely work in isolation, they are recruited by the nervous system and work in groups to perform specific movements or functions. The motion at joints is caused by muscles pulling on bone. An example of muscle synergy is seen through extension of the shoulder, for instance the supine band pullovers above. During this movement the Latissimus Dorsi, teres major, posterior deltoid all work synergistically to perform the movement pattern.

Utilising multi joint or multiplanar movements improves the nervous system’s ability properly recruit muscles in a synergistic manner, improving co-ordination and subsequent carrying over into activities of daily living (ADL’s) enhancing an individual’s movement capabilities and ultimately their quality of life.

Co-ordination is associated with proprioception, or your awareness of your body and movements. Improving this attribute can assist with both static and dynamic balance making everyday tasks a lot easier and helping you in remaining independent throughout your life. Below are three simple strategies to challenge your co-ordination and balance.

- Performing activities like single leg balancing with your eyes closed can be one example of how to challenge your coordination or proprioception.
- If you have a dominant and non-dominant side, try catching a tennis ball in your left hand if you are right-handed whilst performing a single leg balance. This is another variation to challenge your proprioception and specifically hand eye coordination.
- Attempting to learn a new dance routine, or attending a group exercise class is another fantastic way to improve your bodies proprioception and co-ordination ability! The brain is required to co-ordinate various full body movements in synchrony with the music or group instructor. Not only is this another great way to challenge co-ordination and proprioception, but also a unique and fun way to keep active and fit.

## Losing weight and keeping it off

Losing weight and keeping it off is hard work. The process involves a number of lifestyle changes that are long term. If you are looking for a way to get in shape, Summer FOMOTM may be the best solution for you. It is a specially formulated weight loss formula aimed at enhancing thermogenesis and helping your body reach new heights of energy.

### Acacia Fibre

Acacia Fibre is a soluble fibre, which means it absorbs water and becomes gelatinous. This process fills up the stomach, making you feel fuller for longer periods. The combination of increased feelings of satiety, low-energy digestibility, and improved insulin sensitivity leads to better body composition.

Remember that this only works if you combine Acacia Fibre with a healthy diet and exercise routine. You won't achieve results by simply eating more than usual in one sitting. If anything, you'll probably gain weight because your body will store the excess calories as fat.

Unlike most other fibres, Acacia Fibre doesn't taste bitter or cause digestive discomfort because it doesn't ferment within the large intestine as other fibres do. Instead, it passes through the intestines intact because its molecular structure is too large to be broken down by enzymes within the digestive tract. Because of this characteristic, Acacia Fibre has been shown in clinical studies to support regularity.

## L-Glutamine

L-Glutamine plays a crucial role in synthesising protein and amino acids as it helps give strength, energy, and stamina to your body. However, L-Glutamine also helps you burn fat faster and lose weight easily. It can do this by helping your body produce proteins for lean muscle growth and by increasing your metabolic rate so that you burn more calories all day long.

[Taken as a dietary supplement, L-Glutamine](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/l-glutamine?variant=32045275840567) is available in pills, capsules, and powders that you can add to any meal or drink.

Here are some benefits of using L-Glutamine for weight loss:

# Whey Protein Isolate Benefits

For most of us, the idea of whey proteins conjures up images of musclebound bodybuilders or at least a big glass of milk. But as it turns out, this super-concentrated form of protein is one of the most nutrient-dense foods on the planet. And today, this protein powerhouse has gone mainstream to become one of the top nutritional ingredients in many foods and beverages.

## What’s different between whey protein isolate and whey protein concentrate

Before we go into stating the different benefits of Whey Protein Isolate, it is important to note the [difference between Whey Protein Isolate and Whey Protein Concentrate](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/supplements/wpi-vs-wpc-what-s-the-difference?_pos=1&_sid=0982a37f3&_ss=r).

Whey is a type of protein that can be derived from milk. Whey protein concentrate and whey protein isolate are the two primary forms of whey. They are both high-quality protein sources, but there are some differences between the two.

Whey protein concentrate contains more carbs and fat than whey protein isolate. Whey protein concentrate has more calories per gram than whey protein isolate, making it a less lean source of protein. These differences make whey protein isolate a better choice for people trying to lose weight or limit their calorie intake and a better option for those on low-carb diets.

#1 Whey protein isolate can affect satiety

Whey protein isolate is a high-quality form of protein that enhances the satiety effect of food. This allows people to feel fuller for longer periods of time, preventing them from overeating. In addition, whey protein has been shown to prevent the body from absorbing fat and cholesterol, making it an essential component in any weight loss diet or program.

[A study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/87/5/1558S/4650426?login=true) found that whey proteins increase satiety. This can help people stay on course with a diet and resist the temptation to overeat when they are not hungry, preventing unnecessary calories from being consumed.

#2 Whey Protein Isolate is filled with essential amino acids that can promote muscle gain

Whey protein isolate is the ultimate protein powder since it is a concentrated and purified form of whey protein. It's in powder form and pure, meaning it has very few calories and no carbs or fat. It's one of the best sources of protein you can consume.

The best thing about whey isolate is that it contains all the essential amino acids needed to build muscle. Amino acids are the building blocks for muscle tissue, so supplementing your diet with them helps muscle growth. This simply means that WPI can help you build lean muscle and help maintain lean muscle growth.

#3 Whey Protein Isolate helps Boost metabolism

Whey Protein Isolate is one of the best natural supplements for boosting [metabolism and losing weight](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/metabolism-and-eating-for-your-workout?_pos=1&_sid=7875acf89&_ss=r). It contains all nine of the essential amino acids needed to build muscle, which in turn stimulates both metabolism and the loss of excess fat. The faster your body breaks down proteins, the more calories it will burn. This is why consuming foods high in protein speeds up your metabolic rate.

It also [contains leucine](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/leucine-the-king-of-the-amino-acids?_pos=1&_sid=0d3718fe2&_ss=r), an amino acid responsible for stimulating muscle protein synthesis and increasing the body's metabolism. This means that when you ingest whey protein isolate, your body will have an increased metabolic rate and speed up the rate of fat loss and gain lean muscle mass.

### Edited: August 31, 2022

We're down to the final months of the year and it's been months since the majority of people confessed their New Year’s Eve resolutions to their closest friends. How is the momentum going with your fitness goals? If you are one of those people who made a new year’s resolution to start eating healthy but you have now found that your running out of motivation, then this blog is for you.

### How do we ensure that we are able to consistently eat a balanced diet that incorporates all the important macronutrients and micronutrients?

#### GROWTH MINDSET VS FIXED MINDSET

First things first, you need to create a healthy mindset when it comes to eating. In order to have a healthy mindset, you need to first have the ability to have a **“growth mindset.”** People with a growth mindset, as defined by Stanford professor Carol Dweck in her book Mindset, think that their success is contingent on time and effort.

Those with a growth mindset think that by putting in the time, effort, and energy, they can improve at something. They understand that things are always changing around them and the need for adaptability is required. They are aware that failures can and will happen, but understand that is part of the growth process. It is the process that is important here, not the product. They will learn from their failures, so they do not make the same mistake twice. People who have a growth mindset when it comes to nutrition, want to make life-long changes, and improve their lifestyle for the duration.

On the other hand, someone with a **“fixed mindset”** see their qualities as fixed traits that cannot change. They think that their basic nature determines whether they are excellent or poor at anything. Someone with a fixed mindset believes that any kind of adversity is devasting and will often “throw the towel in” at the first sign of it. They are usually focussed on the outcome, rather than the process, and as a result will usually have unrealistic goals when it comes to nutrition. If you feel that you may have a “fixed mindset” then don’t despair, just like everything it takes practice to change.

Once you have a growth mindset, the ability to have a healthy mindset for nutrition will easily follow. You will make daily food choices that align with your goal of changing the process not the outcome. Instead of looking for quick fixes, you will endeavour to learn about the importance of each macro and micro nutrient. You will be honest with yourself with any obstacles and failures on the journey and will adapt and learn from them. You will seek solutions to your barriers.

Sorry, if you were looking for a list of ten things you should stop eating in order to be healthy in 2022 or even a compilation of exotic different “superfoods” to have every morning. But I assure you, practicing and developing a growth mindset is worth way more than any overpriced goji berry smoothie!

**SEO Title:** 3 Steps to a Healthier You in 2022

**SEO Description:** Steps to a healthier you in 2022! That's right, these three simple steps can help you achieve your goals this year. Read on.

---

## Excerpt

No excerpt available

## Content

## You know that you need to take several steps to achieve your goals. It can be overwhelming when you look at the long list: eat right, exercise, work harder, get fit, and many more. This can be hard when you're busy with a full-time job and all of the obligations that come along with it. But it doesn't have to be. We're not telling you to give up everything else in your life — just three things that will make 2022 a healthier year for you.

---

### Step 1: Identify risk areas on your body that are impacting your overall health

It's easy to lose sight of the forest for the trees. You can only see what is in front of you — and perhaps a little bit of what is beyond that.

The same goes for your health. [According to the American Heart Association](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/fats/saturated-fats), a diet high in saturated fat increases your risk for heart disease. As with everything, anything taken in excess can have negative effects.

The trouble is, in day-to-day life, it's easy to lose sight of the big picture when you're dealing with more pressing issues.

So take some time to look at your calendar and identify the problem areas holding you back from being healthier.

Are you frequently tired? Make sure you're getting enough sleep and making time for adequate exercise.

---

### Are you struggling with stress? Assess where you feel most stressed and strategize how to de-stress.

What part of your body do you want to make better? Look at yourself in the mirror and see what you want to change.

After identifying these problems, create solutions tailored toward fixing them in 2022. These solutions should be realistic — don't expect to drop 3kg if you've never stuck to a diet before.

---

### Step 2: Set realistic goals and a weekly schedule to help you reach them

Setting goals is one of the most important and effective things you can do to achieve your goals. Goal setting helps keep you on the right path. It also allows you to focus your energy on what is really important to you. Once you have a goal in mind, a great way to reach your goal is by creating a weekly schedule that will help guide you and hold yourself accountable for getting it done.

The problem is that many people set goals and never reach them because they don't have a schedule or plan to get there. This often happens when people set big goals that are not specific enough. If I say, "I want to lose weight," how much weight am I talking about? 3kgs? 5kgs? Maybe even 10kgs?

That makes all the difference in the world! Without having an exact number in mind, we are setting ourselves up for failure because we are not realistic with our goal setting. A better approach is to be very specific with your goal setting so that you can make it happen:

"I want to lose 50 pounds by July 1, 2022."

---

### Step 3: Stick with your schedule!

Do you want to be healthier in 2022? If you do, stick with your schedule!

It's the most important thing you can do. Schedule a workout routine and stick with it. Schedule a balanced diet and stick to it. Schedule your meals and snacks and stick to them.

Trying to get fit should not be haphazard or chaotic. Once you have established a routine, make sure you stick with it. You can make alterations and adjustments as needed, but don't just wing it. Winging it won't get you anywhere.

If you want to lose weight this year, schedule everything that goes into losing weight: your workouts, diet routine, meal times, and snack times.

We are confident that your health goals will be met if you follow these steps. It won't be an easy road—in fact, it will be slightly challenging. But with the suggested steps and strategies, we hope you will be able to achieve your health goals.

---

### Just a little reminder from us to you:

If you still don't have a good grasp on where you stand with your health, take some time to track how you feel over the next few weeks. Your medical records will tell a story of your personal health history, but only you can tell what it says about your future self. And for those who are concerned about a family history of high blood pressure or cholesterol, consider visiting your doctor for a physical exam and discussing your concerns. The sooner any issues can be caught, the sooner they can be treated—and the healthier you will be in 2022.

**SEO Title:** Exercising during these scorching summer days

**SEO Description:** Exercise is still just as important now as it has ever been. But with these sort of record-breaking temperatures, it’s important to understand what exercise heat exhaustion is, what the signs are, and how you can prevent it this summer.

### 50.7 degrees Celsius. Half way to water’s boiling point.

That was the temperature recorded in Onslow, Western Australia, less than two weeks ago on January 13, 2022. Last week, Perth set a new record by having six days in a row with temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius. There have been more days exceeding 40 degrees in the state this summer than any previous summers. This shouldn’t be too much of a surprise, as according to the Bureau of Meteorology, the recent decade was the warmest on record for Australia, with temperatures about 1 degree Celsius above normal and a third of a degree higher than the preceding decade. We are learning the hard way, that unfortunately, as the earth warms, excessive heat is becoming increasingly prevalent.

### There’s no hiding it, our summers are getting hot.

But that doesn’t necessarily mean you have to put your exercise on the back-burner until midnight February 28th when Autumn takes the spotlight. There’s no way that a backyard cricket match or a beach session of Roundnet, or even a sweaty HIIT session in the park should be canned all together. Exercise is still just as important now as it has ever been. But with these sort of record-breaking temperatures, it’s important to understand what exercise heat exhaustion is, what the signs are, and how you can prevent it this summer.

### Exercise heat exhaustion

Exercise heat exhaustion occurs when your body is unable to expel the excess heat produced during exercise, causing your body temperature to increase over what is considered healthy. Your body temperature and heart rate can rise by not drinking enough water while exercising in the heat. That's because your body can't regulate heat effectively if the overall amount of water in your body is below normal (hypohydration). In order for your body to return to its optimal temperature, it will start to sweat. Sweat allows heat to be removed from the body but it also removes vital fluids. You need to ensure that you are replacing that fluid loss from sweating with water or electrolyte beverages such as VPA® Electrolyte Drink.

### What does heat exhaustion look like?

Well for starters, a body temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius to 40 degrees Celsius is usually a key indicator. Other symptoms include:

- rapid heartbeat & rapid breathing
- heavy perspiration
- dizziness, and fainting

Heat exhaustion is commonly treated by putting an end to the activity and transferring to a cooler location, raising your legs to a position where they are over your head, removing all excess clothing and equipment, and drinking water or a sports drink like VPA® Electrolyte Drink.

### VPA’® Electrolyte Drink

VPA’® Electrolyte Drink aids in replacing water and minerals (specifically sodium and potassium) that are lost through sweat. These minerals are important for muscle contraction, hydration, nerve signaling, and pH balance. The VPA’® Electrolyte Drink comes in two different flavors including grape and orange and are designed to help regulate, refuel, and rehydrate the body. Make sure you are well stocked up on VPA’® Electrolyte Drink for the rest of these scorching summer days.

### What is Protein Powder?

What is protein powder? Protein powder is a supplement that you can add extra protein to your diet. While protein is essential for muscle growth and weight loss, it's also found in many foods. Packing in extra protein, especially if you're into working out, can be extremely helpful for building lean muscle mass and losing weight.

Protein powder is a powdered food supplement made from whey, casein, or soy. It is usually mixed with a liquid (water, milk, or juice) to shake. There are many different types of protein powder, including weight gainers and lean body mass powders. Protein powders can help you build muscle mass, lose fat, improve your performance in the gym, increase your metabolism, and even aid in digestion.

#### Protein Powder Can Help You Build Muscle Mass

Protein powder is the most popular supplement used by bodybuilders and other athletes who want to gain muscle mass. It's easy to use in shakes with all types of liquids, it's portable, it tastes good, and it helps you stay full between meals.

#### Protein Powder Can Help You Lose Fat

While high-protein diets are not a long-term solution to losing weight and keeping it off, they can be helpful for short periods when you want to lose weight quickly or when you're eating primarily protein foods.

#### Protein Powder Can Help Improve Your Performance In The Gym

Protein powder can help you perform better during your workouts because it gives your body extra nutrients. It also helps give your energy a boost.

---

### When Should I Take Protein Powder?

The best time to take protein powder is after a workout. The reasons are simple: you've used up a lot of the energy in your bloodstream, and your muscles are most receptive to replacing it. So, as soon as you finish working out, you want to deliver that energy to your muscles ASAP.

Taking your protein supplements 15 minutes and [up to two hours after working out](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28919842/) is ideal.

### How Much Protein Can I Take?

The amount of protein women need depends on their age, height, weight, and overall health. The amount of protein men need depends on their age, height and weight, but they need much more than women due to their greater muscle mass. An average adult woman needs 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight every day, while an average man needs 1.2 grams of [protein per kilogram of body weight](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-protein-per-day) every day.

### Are There Any Side Effects?

Protein supplement is one of the most popular supplements you can find in the market. You can consider taking it if you have a hectic schedule and you need to boost your muscle strength.

Taken wrong, however, it can be harmful to your health. There are some side effects of protein supplements that you need to know.

One of the side effects of protein supplements is they may contain a lot of sugar, causing a sugar spike. The sugar content may be high because other ingredients like carbohydrates and fats in these supplements are also high. Supplements with high carbohydrate content may cause you to gain weight if you take excess amounts. Also, it can lead to diabetes, especially if you are prone to this condition.

Another side effect of protein supplements is that they may contain harmful substances like banned substances or heavy metals, which can damage your kidney or liver. If you take a protein powder for weight loss, check on its label for ingredients that might cause harm, like ephedrine or other banned substances.

The last side effect of protein supplements is that they may lead to nausea and diarrhea when taken in large dosages than recommended by doctors or manufacturers. Other people are allergic to dairy products, and most protein supplements are made from dairy, which can cause digestive distress. Thankfully, some supplements are [dairy-free](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder) and still [loaded with nutrients and proteins](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder).

Taking these possible side effects into account, it is always better to consult a doctor first and learn more about the products you will use. Make sure that you get...

### Valentine’s Day is the perfect time to celebrate YOU

Valentine’s Day is the perfect time to celebrate YOU. Yes, you. This day has been deemed as a celebration for couples, but it does not have to be. Single or not, you can always celebrate the most romantic holiday of the year. In fact, it's the perfect time to spoil yourself and show yourself some love.

### The real meaning of Valentine’s Day

If you google "Why do we celebrate Valentine’s Day?" the answer that comes up most often is "It started as a pagan holiday honoring Lupercalia. Lupercalia was a festivity of fertility where men and women were paired off. It was not deemed as a romantic holiday then but ended up being one years later.

However, what does Valentine truly mean? Valentine’s Day is about love, and that means all kinds of love. The best kind? It is the love you give yourself. Oftentimes, we are our worst critics, and we tend to be hard on ourselves.

This day is a reminder that if there is anyone in this world that we need to love, it's ourselves. When was the last time you had an intimate conversation with yourself and pinpointed out what you admire about yourself and what you have become? Valentine’s Day might be the best day to start.

### Why you should celebrate every day

You can start on Valentine’s Day to show yourself some appreciation, but it does not have to stop there. Self-love should be practised every day.

Truly, if every day were Valentine's Day, there would be much more love in the world! You don't need another person to have a great day. Sometimes it's nice to treat yourself to something special, whether it's an extra hour of sleep or a new outfit. Love yourself, and you'll love life too! So go ahead and pamper yourself because you deserve it!

### How to celebrate alone (single and not ashamed)

There are lots of reasons why you might be celebrating by yourself on Valentine's Day. Maybe you're single, or perhaps you're happily dating someone who lives far away. Maybe you're estranged from a former partner or spouse. Or maybe your loved ones simply aren't into celebrating the day.

The fact is, many people choose to spend the evening alone. And many singles — and even some couples — prefer it that way. You don't have to feel ashamed about socializing alone on Valentine's Day! There are lots of ways to make the day special for yourself and others.

**Here are a few ways to make sure your Valentine’s Day is an eventful one:**

- Go out to eat with a friend or your family
- Be active!
- Have a day of rest and pampering
- Host a party!

Valentine’s Day is all about celebrating love, giving it, and receiving it. Unfortunately, we rarely brag about our love for ourselves self. Sometimes we even suppress this inherent urge of self-love. So, this Valentine's Day, celebrate your love for yourself.

We need to change our focus and make this holiday not about being in a relationship but rather celebrating our person. That comes by acknowledging what makes us special and unique as a person.

We wish you the sweetest and most romantic Valentine’s Day this 2022.

- From everyone here at VPA® Australia

When it comes to sweating during exercising, there are a couple of myths and misconceptions.

---

## Content

### When it comes to sweating during exercising, there are a couple of myths and misconceptions:

**Truth #1**: *"If I work out and sweat a lot, I will lose weight."*

**FACT:** Well, I suppose that this is partially correct. However, the weight you lose will be water weight rather than fat weight, and it will be replaced when you replenish the necessary fluids during hydration!

---

**Myth #2**: *"If I sweat excessively, it indicates that I am physically unfit."*

**Fact**: Sweating is a method of thermoregulation (i.e., regulating your body temperature), and some people are more efficient at dissipating body heat than others. However, this is NOT a reliable indicator of physical fitness levels. To cool yourself down after exercising, your body generates heat (when muscles contract, the fibres slide over one another, causing friction), and you have four options for releasing this heat. Radiation, convection, conduction, and evaporation are all types of heat transfer. Obviously, sweating falls under the category of evaporation, but if it is running down your neck and armpits, it isn't helping you to cool down at all. Adding some convection (air movement) through a fan will aid in this process because when airflow is added to a wet body, it cools much more quickly than when airflow is added to a dry body.

---

**Ignorance of Myth #3**: *If you aren't sweating when exercising, you aren't exerting yourself sufficiently.*

This is likewise false, according to the facts. The reason for this is the same as in myth 2. During strenuous exercise in a hot environment, your body can lose as much as 1.5 litres of water per day, and as much as that per hour during the exercise. Try to drink approximately 8 cups or 2 litres each day (more if you exercise) in order to stay hydrated. In addition, when consuming foods that contain water, such as fruits and vegetables, fluid intake can occur, contributing to your daily fluid requirements.

### Setting and Achieving Goals

Setting and achieving your goals can be made easier if you follow the advice in the following steps.

- Think about the things you'd like to change in your life. Be specific about the changes you'd like to see. What will you be doing differently in six to twelve months if you are happier than you are now?
- Make a list of all the things you want to accomplish. Attempt to be as descriptive as you can. Goal-oriented people are more likely to achieve than those with ambiguous aims.
- Keep track of your goals in positive terms. Replace "to wake up at 8.00 am" with "to wake up at 8.00 am every day".
- Keep your goals attainable and realistic. It's more probable that you'll fail and be disappointed if you create goals that aren't realistic. Consider your financial situation, time availability, emotional resources, and other aspects of your life to make sure you're being realistic when you set your goals.
- Organize your long-term and short-term goals into separate lists. Give yourself plenty of leeway in terms of the time it will take to achieve your goals. Many short-term goals must be met before a long-term goal can be achieved. Think of these as the ladder rungs that lead up the final step towards your goal of reaching the top. If possible, assign a deadline for the accomplishment of each objective.
- Each aim should be broken down into steps. If your aim is to land a new job, think about the measures you'll need to take to get there. If you're having trouble finding work, it's possible that you'll need to revise your CV, chat with a career counsellor, peruse the local paper, and so on. In the same way as before, set a deadline for each stage.
- Recognize your accomplishments by rewarding yourself when you reach each stage or the ultimate goal. Acknowledging your accomplishments is essential. Each step you take is a sign that you are getting closer to your goals.

## Fitness makes women feel more attractive

Several women have made fitness a part of their lives, from gyms to fitness classes and even simple daily walks. Women who exercise feel more attractive and confident about their bodies. A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5068479/) showed that fitness boosts self-esteem, which helps make one feel more attractive.

## Fitness empowers women to stop comparing themselves to others.

As women, we are constantly bombarded with messages about what's considered beautiful, sexy, and strong. We see magazine covers of airbrushed models and celebrities in movies with perfect abs. It's easy to be sucked into the vortex of comparison, which breeds shame and self-loathing.

When you go to the gym, there are always people in better shape than you as well as people in worse shape. But what's important is that everyone is working on themselves. Everyone is focused on their achievements and progress, you should focus on your own achievement and progress too.

The world of fitness is not a one-size-fits-all kind of place. It's important to remember that there are many paths that lead to the same end goal, which is health and happiness. You don't have to be a professional athlete or bodybuilder to achieve this goal; you just have to find what works for you.

## Fitness makes you realise how strong you are

As women, we are constantly bombarded with images of what beauty is supposed to look like. But there's another side to that coin. What about strength? What about power?

Many women think of fitness as a way to lose weight, and while this may be true for some, I see the practice of exercise as a way to build strength and power — physically, mentally and spiritually.

I believe in the power of fitness because I've seen how it has transformed myself and my clients. When you work out, you discover what your body can do and how strong you are.

In a society that puts an emphasis on looking good (not necessarily feeling good), fitness provides something more: confidence. It makes you feel good inside and out. It empowers you to feel strong.

## Fitness improves mood and reduces stress

Exercise has been proven to reduce the body's stress hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol. It also stimulates the production of endorphins, which are brain chemicals that act as natural painkillers and mood elevators in the body.

Keeping active is a great way to feel better, gain health benefits and have fun. Being active is good for your mental health and wellbeing.

For women, fitness should not be a chore, but rather it should be a rewarding and liberating addition to their lifestyle. Though you get uncomfortable at first, you know that [your reward and progress would be worth it](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/progression-amidst-discomfort).

For many women who have started a fitness routine today, this lifestyle change has resulted in increased confidence, a better appreciation for their bodies, and decreased stress levels. For these reasons and more, incorporating fitness into your routine can be empowering in ways that you may not expect it to be.

### You'll have a goal to work towards

We are all aware that exercise, [together with supplements](https://www.vpa.com.au/collections/supplements-for-weight-loss) is beneficial to our health. It helps us lose weight, increases our stamina and strength, and [reduces our risk of developing serious health conditions like diabetes](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/managing/active.html#:~:text=If%20you%20have%20diabetes%2C%20being,heart%20disease%20and%20nerve%20damage.).

But even with all that knowledge, it can be hard to stick to an exercise routine. We're all busy, and sometimes it's hard to find the time to hit the gym or go for a run. It can even be tedious, especially when you do it alone. Thankfully, there are ways to make exercise more fun and effective — and one of them is joining a fitness challenge.

Fitness challenges can help you stay motivated and reach your goals faster. The competitive aspect of the challenge can help you push yourself harder in each workout, so you'll burn more calories and get into shape more quickly. And having a goal to work towards will help you keep exercising regularly until you've reached your target weight or body fat percentage.

---

### You'll get inspired by the other people

When you're part of a team, you'll get inspired by the other people in the group, and you'll be motivated to stay on track with your fitness goals. And when you do well, those around you will celebrate your success.

When you participate in a challenge, you'll have the opportunity to meet new people with similar interests. You'll also have built-in support for staying on track with your fitness goals.

You will also get inspired by the other people who are participating in the challenge. That's one of the best things about working out with others — there are always stories of personal triumphs and setbacks that will help motivate you and keep you going when life gets tough.

You'll be part of something bigger than yourself. It can be really powerful to know that you're doing the same thing as hundreds (or thousands) of other people all over Australia. You'll feel like part of a community instead of just trying to work out on your own.

---

### You'll be held accountable

You'll be held accountable. Whether it's just showing up to workouts or making healthy food choices, being part of a group will hold you responsible for your actions. That's why so many people join fitness challenges like VPA® Australia's 8-week fitness challenge — they want the sense of community that comes from working out with others who are on the same path as them.

---

### You'll push yourself harder

You'll push yourself harder. When you work out by yourself, it's easy to quit early or slack off when things get tough. But when you have a group pushing you forward and encouraging you to keep going, it's much easier to stay focused and keep pushing yourself.

---

### You'll learn new things

Fitness challenges often have great support and loads of information. Companies would often release guides that can help you during the challenge. This means you may learn new exercises and may even learn a new recipe or two. That's not all, though.

One of the most rewarding aspects of taking on a fitness challenge is that you're bound to learn a thing or two about yourself. This journey will be filled with lots of new information and experiences that you can take with you into your everyday life.

---

### You'll build confidence

Whether it's the first time you've set foot in the gym or you're an avid workout warrior, most people could use a little more confidence in their fitness journey. A fitness challenge provides many opportunities to build your self-esteem and feel good about yourself. As the challenge unfolds, you may be surprised by your strength, flexibility, and overall progress. As you continue to push yourself and discover new limits, it's a surefire way to gain confidence in the gym – and beyond.

---

If you put in the hard work and dedication, fitness challenges can be immensely beneficial. Not only do they spark a sense of motivation and competitiveness in your life, but they can lead to some long-term benefits for your physical well-being. And if you're currently looking for a challenge to join, we suggest starting with the [VPA® Australia's 8-week challenge](https://www.vpa.com.au/pages/8-week-challenge) — this should be one for the history books!

## Challenges and Tips for Fitness Success

Challenges have always been a great way to help you reach your goals, but sometimes we need extra motivation. This is why this post is perfect for you! I wanted to share with you seven practical tips that'll help you stick to your fitness challenges.

### #1 Manage your time well

You may not be able to control the number of hours in a day, but you can certainly control how you spend it. Identify your priorities and focus on them first. Then allocate time for other activities like exercise or new habits. Doing this will limit distractions, so you can dedicate more time to your fitness goals.

### #2 Have an accountability partner

Find someone who will remind you of your goals and will help you stick to them. It can be your spouse, a friend, or someone you met from the fitness challenge. This would help you stay motivated, and having a buddy would help you lose more.

Don't believe us? Well, [research was conducted at North Carolina State University](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10810730.2018.1436622) that showed that those who had accountability buddies lost more weight than those that did not have any support.

### #3 Create a personalised schedule and stick to it

This practical tip can help you with tip #1. To help manage your time, keep a journal of your schedule and activities on it. This would help you plan your day.

Your workout schedule should fit into your lifestyle and around your current commitments. Be realistic about what you will do and make sure you have time for other activities, such as work, schoolwork, spending time with friends and family, or simply relaxing.

### #4 Set up a reward system for yourself

We all have different things we enjoy doing or things that make us happy. Identify those things and set up a reward system for yourself based on meeting specific milestones you've set for your fitness challenge.

Your rewards should be something you look forward to, not something that will distract you from your goals (like a burger and fries). You can also reward yourself by buying guilt-free supplements. We have a variety of supplements you can choose from. This would even help you with your fitness journey! Just make sure your reward doesn't sabotage your efforts! Some great ideas include getting a massage, spending time with friends, or buying new workout clothes.

### #5 Use positive self-talk, not negative self-talk

One important habit that can help you stick to your fitness challenges is positive self-talk. Self-talk is the internal monologue or dialogue that you have with yourself. This voice in your head can be extremely powerful. Positive self-talk can motivate and encourage you to stay on track towards your goals, while negative self-talk can negatively impact motivation and make you feel like giving up on your goals.

One way of preventing negative talk is to stop comparing your progress to others. This is a great way to discourage yourself and lose motivation. Remember that each person has their unique journey and what works for someone else may not work for you. Ask your trainer or coach for advice if you need some additional guidance.

### #6 Don't forget to have fun

If you aren't having fun, you aren't going to stick with your challenge. It might sound simple, but I often see people making fitness so much harder than it needs to be.

Remember that every exercise, nutrition plan and health tip doesn't need to be a "challenge" or a "struggle." Often, if something is too much of a struggle or doesn't feel like fun, it simply means you are doing the wrong thing for yourself!

Be honest about what is necessary to reach your goal and take the rest out of your plan. Besides, learning new things and meeting other challengers are fun on their own.

Sticking with a fitness challenge takes determination and dedication, but it's worth it. You will feel better physically, mentally, and socially once you accomplish your fitness goals. Try out some of our tips to help you find success in your fitness challenge. You will also be more likely to stick with your fitness challenge if you have the right tools and attitude!

## Content

### Roman Poet, Aulus Persius Flaccus, famously once said “he conquers who endures.”
In other words, perseverance will lead to victory. He wasn’t alone in understanding the importance that this nine-letter word represented. Gautama Buddha, popularly known as Buddha, explained that “endurance is one of the most difficult disciplines, but it is to the one who endures that the final victory comes.” Although these quotes were famously recorded in such wide gaps in history (483 B.C and 34 AD to be specific), the take-away message is constant; endurance equals victory. It’s because of this, that it should not come as too much of a shock, that nowadays endurance training is a popular form of training.

### What is endurance training?
What is endurance training you might ask? Well, the word endurance, both philosophically and in terms of physical activity, means to maintain concentration and persevere in the face of adversity. Endurance training is there for linked to the capacity to work for long periods of time. To be more specific, any physical activity that increases your heart rate by above 50% of your maximum. This can then be categorised into either cardiovascular endurance or muscular endurance.

### Cardiovascular Endurance or Muscular Endurance?
Most athletes are referring to aerobic endurance when talking about cardiovascular endurance. That is, the capacity of your heart and lungs to provide oxygen (and remove carbon dioxide) to your body. Some examples include:
- Walking
- Running
- Jogging
- Hiking
- Swimming

Muscular endurance refers to your muscles' capacity to perform constantly without tiring. Some examples include:
- Squats
- Pushups
- Planks
- Rows

### Specific Endurance or General Endurance?
We can further categorise endurance training into either specific endurance or general endurance. The capacity to resist exhaustion under sport-specific settings is referred to as specific endurance. This basically refers to training for endurance based on a sport-specific discipline. For example, if you are a swimmer, you will utilise a range of different endurance training methods to perform better at your specific swimming distance.
The other type of endurance training involves the capacity of your entire body to withstand endurance workouts and reduce tiredness and to which is known as general endurance.

### Who is Endurance Training for?
So, who should be utilising endurance training? Well, in short, everyone! Endurance exercise increases your overall fitness and maintains your heart, lungs, and circulatory system to a healthy level. However, athletes should focus mainly on specific endurance training to reap its benefits for improved performance.

### Most common methods of Endurance Training?
The most common kind of endurance training is basic endurance training, which consists of low-intensity, high-volume workouts that last at least 30 minutes. Periodization, intervals, hard easy, and, more recently, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) have all proven to be beneficial methods for endurance training. The HIIT method involves short bursts of intensive effort, ranging from 10 to 60 seconds, followed by an active recuperation time of the same duration or longer.

### What are some safety tips for Endurance Training?
When partaking in Endurance training it’s important that you always make time for an adequate warm-up. Knowing your limits and not going too hard too quickly and ensuring as always, that you are focussing on quality over quantity is vital in getting the most out of your training.

### The time has finally arrived! It’s the time to launch the VPA® 8 Week Challenge. This is your time to shine, to put those New Years Resolutions finally into action.

Here are five quick nutrition tips to help get you along on your journey.

---

### 1. There’s no such thing as super-foods, eat a balanced diet

You don’t need to be eating expensive Goji berries in order to be healthy or to smash out your goals for the VPA® 8 Week Challenge. There really is no such thing as a super food; all foods have their nutrient qualities. Goji berries might contain high levels of healthy antioxidants such as zeaxanthin but so do a range of green leafy vegetables (spinach, kale, broccoli). Don’t spend a fortune buying into the latest trends; just eat a balanced diet full of variety. Variety in our diet is crucial not just to reap the benefits of consuming a diverse range of critical vitamins and minerals, but also to avoid consuming too much (or too little) of any given nutrient.

---

### 2. Make sure you are staying hydrated

Did you know dehydration affects 80 percent of Australians, yet the majority of people are unaware of the signs and symptoms. Drinking adequate water each day is important for a variety of reasons, including body temperature regulation, joint lubrication, infection prevention, nutrition delivery to cells, and organ performance. Sleep quality, cognition, and mood all benefit from being well-hydrated which is what you will be needing during the VPA® 8 Week Challenge. An easy way to make sure you are getting enough H20 in is to drink two glasses of water before leaving the house in the morning and another when you get to work or your destination. Also make sure that no matter where you go make sure you fill a reusable bottle with water; this will encourage you to drink more, save you money on bottled water, and protect the environment.

---

### 3. Be organised so you can still be social!

Don’t let the VPA® 8 Week Challenge stop you from remaining social and going out for lunch or dinner with family and friends. You can still enjoy socialising without compromising your challenge goals. You just need to make sure you are organised. By calling the restaurant or café ahead of time, you can discuss your dietary requirements and determine what food is suitable for you.

---

### 4. Monitor the oils that are you consuming

Oils contain a lot of calories and are a good source of energy. Including oils in your diet is an excellent method to get vital fats in and aid in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins including A, D, E, and K. The kind of fat ingested is equally as significant as the overall quantity of fat taken in terms of health. Each tablespoon of olive, coconut, canola, and vegetable oils has roughly the same number of calories. One tablespoon of coconut oil has 117 calories, olive oil has 119 calories and canola oil has 120 calories. Make sure that you are factoring in oil when monitoring your intakes.

---

### 5. Don’t cut out entire food groups

Even if your goal for the VPA® 8 Week Challenge is to lose body fat, don’t jump on the band wagon of cutting out entire food groups such as carbohydrates. Yes, you may lose weight initially by removing them from your diet. But in order to prevent “challenge burn-out” you need to make sure you still eat the foods that you enjoy but in a moderation that suits your calorie intake.

### Making an appropriate nutrition plan

Making an appropriate nutrition plan to go along with an optimal bodybuilding, weight-loss and muscle-building fitness routine can be a time-consuming endeavour with a list that typically includes but is not limited to the following:

- Planning how many days a week you're going to exercise
- What exercises you're going to include in your programme
- How long your rest periods will be
- How many reps you're going to execute for each activity

### Easy pointers to keep in mind

Consequently, here are a few easy pointers to keep in mind when doing so.

![Image](https://i.shgcdn.com/e3052d69-da8b-47f0-8d0e-4d2eb9d91fa9/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

### Tip #1: Progressive overload

The ability to consistently add more weight to the barbell is the single most important factor influencing your rate of muscle gain. It doesn't matter how many principles you employ; if you aren't raising the total amount of weight you are lifting over a period of several months, you will not be gaining muscle at the rate that you would otherwise be. As a result, you begin experimenting with other tactics such as drop sets and super sets as a means of increasing the body's potential, with the goal of bumping it up to the next weight level within a few more weeks.

### Tip #2: Keep in mind the law of failure

When it comes to building muscle, many people believe that lifting to failure on each and every single set is the most effective method. While this may be true, there are a lot of issues that can arise when you are lifting to failure on a consistent basis. A key problem is tiredness of the central nervous system (CNS). It is extremely taxing on the CNS to participate in workout routines that are designed to fail every time.

### Tip #3: Compound Workouts

If you squander your time at the gym on exercises that only engage one or two minor muscle groups, you are not getting the most out of your workout. You have a limited amount of time each day to spend in the gym owing to both time and recovery constraints. Follow the guideline that you will only perform exercises that work at least two muscle groups for around 80 percent of your workout. Compound lifts are also more effective since they allow you to raise a greater amount of weight in one movement.

### Tip #4: Take breaks

Remind yourself to take regular breaks. The mistake that many people make is to workout too hard and too frequently without taking time to recover.

### Tip #5: Fuel your body before and after your workouts

Make sure you're fueling your body properly both before and after your bodybuilding workouts by adhering to a successful nutrition plan. An important oversight that will result in a lack of results is the failure to consume enough protein to fuel your body's efforts to build muscle mass, as well as enough carbohydrates to fuel your body's efforts to generate new muscle mass.

# Electrolytes: How Much Do You Really Need?

**Author:**  

**Tags:** 

**SEO Title:** Electrolytes: How Much Do You Really Need?

**SEO Description:** Electrolytes are essential especially when one is active. But how much do you really need? Read on and find out more.

## Excerpt

## Content

### Electrolytes And Hydration

Electrolytes are minerals that are involved in many essential functions, such as muscle contraction and nerve transmission. They affect the amount of fluid that is retained by the body and impact a variety of biochemical reactions. [Electrolytes](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002350.htm) include sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+) and chloride (Cl-).

Electrolytes are lost through sweat and urine. If you exercise in the heat for an hour or more, it's important to replenish these lost electrolytes, even if you don't feel thirsty. A mixture of water and salt tablets will help maintain optimal blood sodium levels during exercise, thereby improving performance and preventing muscle cramping or weakness.

Water should be your main drink during exercise, but sometimes you need to replace more than just water. Sports drinks that contain electrolytes can be helpful, especially when exercising and working out.

### Why Do We Need Electrolytes?

As mentioned, the main function of electrolytes is to maintain the proper balance of fluids in your body. Balance is essential in your nerves and muscles. Your nerves rely on electrolytes to transmit messages throughout your body, while your muscles use electrolytes to contract (like when you lift weights). Without the right balance, your cells can't work properly.

When you don't have enough electrolytes in your system, it can cause some serious problems, including:

- Muscle spasms
- Irregular heartbeat
- Seizures
- In some cases, an electrolyte imbalance can even be fatal.

### How Much Water Should I Drink?

How much water do you really need? You may have heard the eight-glasses-of-water-a-day rule, but that's not backed by science. There's no hard and fast rule for how much water a person should drink. But what is for sure is that not drinking enough can lead to dehydration.

The amount of water that someone should drink truly [depends on your body and your activity](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/8-glasses-of-water-per-day#TOC_TITLE_HDR_2), but most adults should drink [2.5 to 3 litres of water per day](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/water-a-vital-nutrient). If you're still worried about dehydration, you can always follow the eight glasses or 2.5 to 3 litres rule.

### Electrolytes For Exercise And Workouts

All the electrolytes are essential, but some are more important than others to prevent exercise-induced hyponatremia.

Sodium is the most important for preventing exercise-induced hyponatremia or low blood sodium. Sodium is the most important electrolyte to supplement during exercise because sodium is the electrolyte that gets lost in the highest amounts in sweat and urine. A person can have sweat loss that reaches [10–12 litres per day](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2267797/). This is a lot! And this amount of sodium loss can negatively affect our health and performance if we don't replace it.

The second most important electrolyte to replace during exercise is potassium. The reason potassium is second on our list of important electrolytes for exercise is that it gets lost in high amounts in sweat and urine. And because potassium also plays an important role in muscle contractions and blood pressure regulation, this makes it a vital electrolyte to replace during exercise.

Hydration is important for good health, especially during intense exercise. The right amount of fluids can help you avoid fatigue, headaches, and cramps. Whether you are exercising or not, hydration is just as important—most [human bodies are nearly 60% water](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/water-you-water-and-human-body#:~:text=Up%20to%2060%25%20of%20the,bones%20are%20watery%3A%2031%25). Don't be afraid to ask your doctor if you have any questions about how much water you should drink each day.

### What's better than pancakes? Protein pancakes. And if you're not convinced, here are some reasons why protein pancake mixes are better.

#### What is a Protein Pancake Mix

As the name suggests, protein pancakes are a protein-packed variation of traditional pancakes. They're often made with ingredients like oats and yogurt rather than flour and butter, which gives you a protein boost for your morning meal.

---

#### Why Should I Use a Protein Pancake Mix?

Since protein is essential for muscle building and our body's daily functions, it's important to incorporate enough protein into our diets. However, getting all the protein you need in every meal can be challenging, especially during breakfast. Because many breakfast foods are carb-heavy and lack protein, they're not very filling. This may cause you to be hungry soon after eating breakfast or even reach for an unhealthy snack to curb hunger until lunchtime. We've all been there!

Protein pancakes can help combat this problem by providing an easy way to get your fill of protein first thing in the morning. Plus, it'll help keep you full so that you won't feel the need for that mid-morning snack break!

---

### The Benefits of Protein Pancake Mix

You will learn about the benefits of a product through its ingredients. Since there are different types and kinds of protein pancake mixes on the market, we would like to focus on VPA® Protein pancake mix.

---

Here is a breakdown of its ingredients and what benefits you can get from them:

Psyllium husk and inulin

Inulin is a polysaccharide that comes from plants, such as potatoes and bananas. It's found naturally in some fruits and vegetables. Inulin has the ability to help digestive issues by stopping cravings for sugar, which causes bloating and inflammation. And it regulates bowel movements, which is essential for people suffering from diarrhea.

Psyllium husk is a fiber that comes from seeds. Adding some psyllium husk to your diet can help reduce cholesterol levels, which means less blood clots, less heart damage, and fewer strokes. It also can improve digestion by thinning out mucus in the intestines so wastes can move through more easily.

---

### WPC:

[WPC has many benefits for muscle growth and recovery](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/premium-whey-wpc) from exercise. It contains large amounts of amino acids, particularly BCAA's, that stimulate muscle protein synthesis for growth after a workout and L-glutamine for recovery. But it also contains other beneficial ingredients that may enhance the effects on muscle growth and recovery.

---

### Medium-Chain Triglycerides:

Medium-chain triglycerides, or MCTs, are a type of fat found in coconut oil and other foods. Unlike other fats, [MCTs are rapidly absorbed and used for energy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2874191) by the body. They can also be used to help you lose weight. Our protein pancake is also low in sugar and has over 26g of protein per serve.

---

### Why is it better than a regular pancake mix?

The typical breakfast pancake is high in carbohydrates and calories, low in fat and protein, and has little to no fiber. Protein pancakes contain more protein than their carb-laden counterparts, plus essential vitamins and minerals.

They can be lower in carbohydrates, depending on the recipe used. A protein pancake can also contain more healthy fats than a traditional breakfast pancake.

Protein Pancake Mix has a higher nutritional value overall compared to a traditional pancake.

If you're trying to eat healthier, a great place to start is by replacing your normal breakfast with a protein-packed meal. Pancakes are a quick, easy and delicious option for your morning meal, but many people find that their typical batter recipe is too heavy or too sweet.

If this sounds like you, consider switching to a protein pancake mix instead. They're packed with more protein and less sugar — making them a much healthier choice.

## For the Mum Who Loves to Work Out Indoors: ZOGIN Mini Exercise Desk Bike

Mums who are trying to get fit have it tough. Not only do they have to find time in their schedules to work out, but they also have to make arrangements for someone to watch their kids when they do so. That's why a ZOGIN Mini Exercise Desk Bike is perfect for a mum who works out indoors. It lets her get the exercise she needs while still being available to listen to her children tell their stories and help with homework.

The first thing you notice about this bike is that it's small and compact. While most stationary bikes take up a lot of room, you can tuck this one into any corner of your house and even roll it into another room if you want to change locations. If you're short on space, or simply want a bike that's easy to store, this may be the right fit for your mother!

## For the Mum Who is Constantly on Her Feet: Harmony Tea

There's nothing like a good pick-me-up for every tired mum, especially for the mum who is always on her feet. A day in the life of a mum means constantly being "on" and ready to be there for their kids. When you're trying to fit in work and errands on top of that, it can be easy to forget to prioritize self-care. But when mothers don't take care of themselves, it's not only you who suffers; your family will be affected too.

VPA® Harmony Tea is a wonderful way to reinvigorate oneself each day and restore equilibrium in life. As a busy mom, your mother needs to be healthy and alert in order to function at her best—and this tea can help. It promotes a balanced immune system and keeps your energy levels up without caffeine or any other stimulant, so whether you're taking it in the morning before the chaos of the day begins or as an afternoon pick-me-up after lunch, it'll give her the boost she needs to keep going strong.

## For The Mum Who Does Yoga: Tibetan Singing Bowl Set

When it comes to Mother's Day gifts, we tend to get caught in the obvious trap: "I know she loves flowers and chocolate, so those must be the best gifts!" But while it's a time-honored tradition to give your mum a bouquet or take her out for dessert, there are plenty of other ways you could celebrate her.

If your mum is into yoga, then you've probably gotten her more than one mat over the years. (There's only so much use one can get from a mat before it needs replacing.) What we suggest is something unique for your mum - a Tibetan singing bowl.

A Tibetan singing bowl set is a great gift for the mother who enjoys yoga because it is something that she can use to enhance her practice. Singing bowls have been used for centuries in various religious practices, particularly Buddhism. They are said to calm the mind and relax the body. A set of singing bowls can be used in meditation or in yoga practice to focus the senses. It's definitely a unique gift that will show your mum that you care about her well-being and are interested in what she does!

---

## For The Mum With A Sweet Tooth Who Needs An Energy Boost: VPA® Protein Bars

A protein bar is a great gift for the busy mum who needs an energy boost. And, if she has a sweet tooth, VPA® Australia’s Protein Bars are the perfect gift because they contain 18g of protein and are infused with real chocolate. These gourmet chocolate-flavoured bars are a great way to treat your mum, while at the same time getting all the fitness benefits associated with high-quality protein powders and snacks.

The cold winter months can be challenging. It is important to ensure that you stay active during these months to avoid the winter blues. So how do we do it? Here are some tips on how you can make sure to keep active during the cold winter months.

## Get out the door

It may seem like a simple suggestion, but getting up and out of bed can be tough when facing dark mornings and cold weather. If you know you want to exercise, set yourself an alarm 30 minutes before your usual wake-up time so don't oversleep. This will ensure that you get up when it's still dark outside but also give yourself enough time to prepare for your workout routine without rushing around frantically in a mad panic.

## Get active with your pet

Go for walks with your pet. Walking is a great way to get exercise, but if it's too cold outside for outdoor walking, take your dog or cat for a walk on a treadmill inside instead! Or, if you don't have a pet, borrow one from a friend or neighbour so you can go walking together!

## Try a new workout class

Many different fitness classes are available at gyms throughout the city and online. This includes indoor cycling, HIIT training, yoga, Bootcamp, and spin classes. These classes are great because they keep your heart rate up but don't require extra equipment beyond an indoor bike or treadmill.

Roll out your mat. If you don't have access to a class, try doing yoga at home using YouTube videos or DVDs (do they still exist, though?). Yoga is great for increasing flexibility and strength, plus it's meditative too! You can also do some stretching exercises right in your living room after work if you get home early enough.

## Find a gym buddy and make it a weekly date to workout together

Find a gym buddy and make it a weekly date to workout together. Instead of hitting the gym alone and feeling lonely, why not join forces with someone else who has similar goals? This way, you'll have someone there to motivate you if you feel unmotivated after a long day at work. Try not to skip any of these dates, as this will help you stay motivated during the cold months ahead.

## Having a workout partner makes it easier to stick to your exercise routine because they will keep you accountable. Make sure you choose someone who has similar goals as you do so that you can encourage each other and push each other to reach them!

Most gyms offer free trial memberships, which means there's no risk involved if you decide not to join after your challenge ends. You can try out different classes before deciding which ones work best for you.

## Sign Up For A Fall/ Autumn gym Challenge

Fall is a great time to get into shape. It's not too hot, and you don't have to worry about getting a sunburn. You can stay active through the winter months by signing up for a fall/ autumn challenge.

## Get off the couch and dance!

Dancing is an excellent way to burn calories and have fun at the same time! You can dance solo or with a group of friends at home or in a community centre near you. If you don't know how to dance, try looking up some easy beginner steps online so that you can master them before hitting the floor!

## Get some fresh (but cold) air

Going for a walk, run, or bike ride will help keep you warm and can help you stay fit. You'll also be getting those endorphins and fresh air that you need to beat the winter blues.

You don't need to stay indoors for winter. Instead, take a walk outside. This can help boost your mood and relieve stress. And since fresh air has anti-inflammatory properties, it can improve lung function and reduce asthma symptoms when taken regularly.

Don't let the cold keep you cooped up inside this winter. Use these tips to stay active and motivated. There are plenty of ways to keep your body and mind healthy in spite of the weather including being consistent with your [protein supplement intake](https://www.vpa.com.au/collections/best-sellers).

Together with a balanced diet and daily supplements, make one of these activities your new daily (or weekly) routine, and you'll wonder why you ever thought the winter season was all that bad in the first place.

### The Right Clothes Can Encourage You to Workout

No matter what you think, your clothing (yes, your clothing) matters when working out. While it might be easy to pass on this type of purchasing and advice, buying the right clothing can make a real difference in your performance. Whether you're doing CrossFit, running, or weightlifting, having the right clothes to work out in is important.

---

### Some Clothes Can Increase Performance

The proper workout clothes can increase performance. It's not a myth! The proper clothing is essential to maximizing your workout, whether you're running in the park or lifting weights at the gym.

There are three main types of clothing for different types of physical activity. These types include:

- Performance-oriented garments.
- Water-repellent garments.
- Waterproof garments.

When you're working out, comfort is vital. You want to enjoy yourself without having to worry about being in pain or feeling restricted by your clothing. This is especially true if you plan on working out for more than an hour at a time. Longer workouts usually require more flexible clothing that doesn't restrict movement while allowing sweat to evaporate quickly, so you don't overheat while exercising.

---

### The Right Clothes Prevent Injury & Accidents

Does what you wear really affect your workout performance? The answer is a resounding yes!

The right clothes can provide greater comfort and strength. The wrong ones can lead to injury or discomfort. Here are some of the most common types of workout clothes that can help you prevent injuries:

- Running shoes
- Sports bras
- Compression shorts

---

### The Right Clothes Make You Feel Great About Yourself

When it comes to fitness, your clothes can make a big difference. If you feel good about how you look and what you're wearing, it's easier to motivate yourself to hit the gym or run.

The right workout clothes also help keep you comfortable during your workout. They aren't too tight or too loose, so they don't restrict your movement and cause chafing or irritation. And when you look great and feel good, your workout can be more enjoyable than ever before!

---

### Quick Tips on How To Choose The Right Workout Outfits:

- Choose breathable fabrics.
- Make sure the clothes are the right size.
- Wear shoes that fit properly and have good arch support.

---

### Bottomline:

The clothes you wear can play an essential role in your performance and physical development during your workouts. The wrong clothing can prevent you from achieving your fitness goals, whether that means building muscle or losing weight. So if you're serious about getting in shape and becoming healthier, give some thought to what you're wearing as well. Invest in some quality workout clothes, and you might see a marked improvement in your fitness level – especially if your current workout attire is holding back your performance.

# Why Meal Replacement Shakes are A Great Way To Lose Weight

**SEO Title:** Why Meal Replacement Shakes are A Great Way To Lose Weight

**SEO Description:** Meal replacement shakes are the most convenient, cost effective and the most effective weight loss tool in today's market. If you haven't yet made that switch to meal replacement shakes, then here is why you should.

---

## Excerpt

No excerpt available

## Content

### For starters, we'd like to acknowledge that the best source of nutrients come from a well-balanced meal. However when you are constantly on the go and are pressed for time, or are wanting to jump start your weight loss journey, meal replacement shakes may come in handy.

Meal replacement shakes have become one of the most popular ways to lose weight over the past decade. Whether looking to shed a few pounds or start a healthy lifestyle, it's essential to choose meal replacement shakes that are both nutritionally dense and delicious. Meal replacement shakes are great because they are specially formulated to give you everything you need to lose weight and keep it off.

Please note, that this is not for long-term use so it would be best to consult a physician since there is no definitive answer until when you should take them.

---

## What's In A Meal Replacement Shake?

Most meal replacement shakes contain some combination of protein, carbohydrates, and fat. Most brands add vitamins and minerals as well as fibre which helps with digestion and absorption of nutrients from food sources.

Some meal replacement shakes contain additional ingredients designed to help with digestion or weight loss (like green tea extract), which VPA Australia has.

---

## Skip the confusion of counting calories and tracking macros.

When trying to lose weight, it's easy to get bogged down in all the numbers: calories, carbs, fats, and protein. But when you're trying to eat right, it can be hard enough to decide what to eat each day, let alone how many grams of fat or carbs are in each dish. Meal replacement shakes take away this confusion by giving you a pre-measured serving of all of your nutrients — so that all you have to do is add water or milk and blend it into a smoothie.

---

## Save time and money by not eating out as often.

You can prepare your shake right at home, so it doesn't take extra time or effort. Meal replacement shakes are also great when you have no appetite or don't have time to cook a healthy meal on your own.

---

## Lose weight without being hungry or feeling deprived.

Meal replacement shakes are a convenient way to lose weight. They are explicitly designed to help you lose weight without feeling hungry or deprived.

Meal replacement shakes usually contain fewer calories than the same amount of food, so they are an easy way to reduce your calorie intake.

Meal replacement shakes work mainly because they reduce hunger and cravings. The more you can cut down on hunger, the easier it will be for you to lose weight.

It is also important to note that meal replacement shakes are not a magic pill or cure-all for weight loss. To get the best results from a meal replacement shake program, you must follow an exercise program and stick to a healthy diet plan.

---

## They Offer Variety

Another reason why meal replacement shakes are great for losing weight is because they offer variety, so there is no boredom involved when using them as part of your diet plan. There are many different flavours available on the market today, so there is something for everyone's taste buds, whether it be chocolate or vanilla or something like a strawberry banana! Try combining flavours too! [VPA Australia offer a variety of flavours that you would love](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/lean-shake-plus-meal-replacement?_pos=1&_sid=fcea46e6b&_ss=r)!

---

They're easy to bring and take with you, making staying on track easier.

Using a meal replacement shake for weight loss is an excellent choice for many reasons. These shakes provide all the essential nutrients that the body needs and they can be tailored to your individual health goals. The shakes are not only convenient for losing weight, but they can also help you lose weight using a healthy diet plan.

**SEO Description:** Hydration is just one of the most vital therapy for your body to fight off a cold. Here are a couple more remedies that you can use that works.

## What actually is a common cold?

A virus is a minuscule and transmittable agent that causes an illness. The most common virus that causes a cold is the rhinovirus. Although the rhinovirus is responsible for more than 50% of common cold cases, there are over 200 other, different types that could also be the culprit.

## So how do you get the virus in the first place?

When a sick person coughs, sneezes, or speaks, the virus can spread by airborne droplets. Additionally, it can be transferred by direct hand-to-hand contact with a sick person or by exchanging infected items such as drink bottles or dining utensils. You run the risk of contracting a cold if you touch your eyes, nose, or mouth after this kind of contact.

## There is a vaccine… right?

Unfortunately, there is no vaccine for the common cold; but there are different ways to decrease the speed of its spread. Some of the methods to prevent the transmission of this illness include frequent hand washing, cough concealment, avoiding contact with sick individuals, and not sharing objects. Some remedies can help prevent the severity of symptoms.

## What is some common cold treatment that works?

### Stay hydrated.

First things first, you need to stay hydrated. When you have a common cold you often suffer from a high fever which can result in dehydration. The excessive sweating that usually comes with a cold means that crucial water is released through the glands and if you are losing more fluid than you are replacing, dehydration can occur. You need to make sure you are replacing all the fluid that is lost by increasing the amount of water you are consuming or by having a VPA Electrolyte Drink.

### Rest

Your body is working in overdrive trying to fight off the virus. Your body will be better able to fight off your sickness and build up its immune system if you try and get more sleep than you normally would. Plus, seeing as your energy levels have most likely dropped, the extra sleep would be very enticing. To assist your body fight off the virus once you have a cold, you must get enough sleep. Take the first three days very slowly.

### Gargle

When your voice resembles a croaky frog or your coughing starts to sound like the neighbourhood dog, it might be time to give some gargling a go. Gargling might temporarily soothe a sore throat by moistening it. Aim for four times per day, gargle with 1 cup of warm water and a half teaspoon of salt.

### Try a nasal saline spray

Saline nasal sprays contain a mixture of salt and water that is sprayed into your nose to help moisten the mucous membranes and thin out thick mucus. This makes it easier for you to clear the mucus from your nose, which helps reduce congestion.

Saline sprays can also be used as a preventive measure against colds by helping thin out mucus in the upper respiratory tract before it becomes sticky and thick with virus particles.

### Steam Inhalation

Steam inhalation can help relieve congestion by loosening mucus in the nasal cavity. It works by opening up nasal passages so that air can flow freely through them. This reduces the feeling of stuffiness and helps clear away mucus from the nose, throat, and sinuses.

The moist heat produced by steam inhalation also relaxes muscles in the chest, which helps to open up the airways for easy breathing.

Heat also stimulates blood flow in the body which improves circulation throughout your body including your lungs. This means that your immune system is better able to fight off viruses that cause colds and allergies such as pollen or dust mites.

### Cough Drops

Cough drops work by adhering to the back of your throat and coating it with a protective layer that helps prevent irritation. Since they're sweet, they also help to relieve sore throats by stimulating saliva production.

[Cough drops can help ease symptoms in mild cases](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/cough-and-cold-combinations-oral-route/before-using/drg-20061164) of dry mouth or sore throat but aren't recommended for severe cases. If you're suffering from severe pain or swelling in your throat area due to tonsillitis or laryngitis, consult your doctor before using cough drops.

If the cold or winter conditions keep you from regular physical activity, you're not alone. Many of us know what It feels like waking up to your alarm going off and the wind howling or the rain pouring. For many of us, Aussies who are used to the warmer summer weather, often the mercury is hovering further south than we would like it to.

---

It's often safer, more comfortable and warmer in bed, and that's where many of us remain promising to be up at the crack of dawn the following day when the alarm goes off. However, the statistics are grim and physical activity is responsible for 11% of Australia's coronary artery disease burden and around 15% of other associated diseases.

---

Staying active throughout winter is not only a way to warm yourself up during winter but also a way to beat heart disease and other health conditions. Physical activity shouldn't be seen as an obstacle but rather an opportunity for health.

---

If you want to avoid the doom and gloom or cold associated with exercising outdoors during winter, the obvious solution is to exercise indoors. With all that we learned during the COVID-19 pandemic, thinking logistically to overcome barriers to face-to-face services has brought rise to more commonality of telehealth and online health care services being offered over the computer. With this, a whole host of different online programs and technologies have come about:

- [Join in on YouTube workouts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XMCIf8vLxk) like a walk at home - Aerobics Down Under or Aerobics Oz style and keep warm whilst exercising in the comfort of your home.
- Staircases in the home can be a useful tool for keeping active indoors. Download a metronome app on your I-phone or tablet and set a step cadence specific to your fitness levels.
- If you are working from home, attempt to break up periods of prolonged sitting every 20-30 minutes, where possible, through a brisk walk around the house.

---

With structured exercise, it's always important to warm up first. However, this is even more important during the colder winter months.

- Make sure you dress appropriately for the conditions, and gloves or a beanie may be suitable options if required.
- If you plan to exercise during the week, you take some time to evaluate the weather and conditions and schedule your days accordingly.
- Try to get outdoors, make the most of sunnier days, and save the colder, wet weather for exercising indoors.

---

Exercise isn't always easy during winter; however, it's well worth the effort from a health perspective. If you are already living with a chronic health condition, consult your general practitioner to ask them about getting a team care arrangements to plan where you can book a consultation with an accredited exercise physiologist either online via telehealth or face to face. Visit [essa.org.au](https://www.essa.org.au/find-aep/) to find a practitioner in your local area for an exercise program to help you keep active during the colder months.

## WPI/ Whey Protein Isolate

As you start your 8 Week Challenge, you’ll want to ensure that you have the necessary tools before beginning this program. Aside from the meal guides provided within the program, supplementation can help you reach your fitness goals, particularly if your diet doesn't provide you with all the necessary nutrients.

We have a few suggestions that can aid you in achieving your fitness objectives. Whey protein isolate, however, is our number one recommendation. The supplements listed below have a solid track record of helping users reach their fitness objectives when used consistently.

## How does it work?

Whey protein isolate is considered a high-quality form of whey because it has been filtered to remove most of the lactose and fat molecules, leaving behind a pure form of whey protein.

Because it contains very little carbohydrate, it's less likely to be stored as fat than other types of protein. It also takes time for your body to digest, so you feel full for longer after eating foods containing whey protein isolate than you do after eating foods containing other types of protein.

This can make it easier for you to lose weight by helping you eat fewer calories without feeling hungry.

### Benefits:

- Helps build muscle mass and strength
- Promotes better digestion and absorption of nutrients
- Increases energy levels by boosting metabolism and providing fuel for muscles
- Lowers cholesterol levels because it contains no saturated fat or cholesterol
- Decreases appetite by making you feel full longer

## WPC/ Whey Protein Concentrate

WPC is a combination of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. It contains a large percentage of protein, essential fats, vitamins, minerals, and electrolytes. This combination makes it an excellent source of nutrients that support muscle growth and recovery after intense exercise.

### How does it work?

Whey protein concentrate contains a large amount of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) that are essential for muscle growth and repair. The body breaks down BCAAs to form glucose and uses them as fuel during exercise. This process helps delay fatigue during exercise and makes you more resilient to injury. Whey also contains glutamine, which helps promote muscle growth by improving recovery time between workouts.

### First, what are the causes of Sleep Deprivation?

Sleep deprivation is seen more common globally now more than ever as people sacrifice their sleeping schedules to do more work. It also affects growing teens because the lack of sleep may stunt their growth and disrupt hormonal changes essential to a growing person.

Sleep deprivation is not a disease but rather an effect of a cause. It can be caused by several reasons, namely:

### 1. Sleep disorders

Sleep disorders like insomnia, narcolepsy, and sleep apnea are the leading causes of sleep deprivation. These disorders make falling asleep difficult or make you wake up early, disabling you from getting enough sleep.

### 2. Stress and hormonal imbalance

Stress has several effects that coincide with your sleep, especially the production of cortisol, the stress hormone. Usually, cortisol is an important hormone when balanced, however, a hormonal imbalance of cortisol can affect your sleep by affecting normal melatonin levels in your body.

### 3. Other illnesses

Illnesses like depression, cancer, Alzheimer's, and schizophrenia affect your sleep by messing with hormonal levels in your body. Fear and anxiety are commonly linked to sleep loss due to depression. If you have ever spent a night tossing and turning, you already know how you’ll feel the next day — tired, cranky, and out of sorts. These are the more obvious effects of sleep deprivation however, regularly missing out on the [recommended 7-8 hours of sleep](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/the-importance-of-sleep-is-sleep-the-reason-you-re-not-seeing-results-in-the-gym) can lead to more serious consequences when our bodily functions start to suffer.

### Sleep deprivation experiments

You’ve probably heard of the horrors of the ‘Russian Sleep Experiment’, a popular creepy urban myth that circulated around the internet in the early 2010’s which we will leave to you to read more in detail however, (spoiler alert) while the horrific experiment did not actually take place, there are a few people who have gone more than week without sleep, and one such experiment was done by a student named [Randy Gardner](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180118-the-boy-who-stayed-awake-for-11-days). The boy stayed awake for 11 days or 264 hours for his high school science project in 1963 which made history.

During the experiment, he suffered from foggy memory, poor concentration, dizziness, slurred speech, and even hallucinations and paranoia. After the project was over, Gardner slept for 14 hours straight and woke up feeling normal again, without any long-lasting consequences of sleep deprivation.

### Effects of Sleep Loss

Putting this experiment aside, [research has shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19961/) that sleep loss (less than 7 hours per night) or prolonged sleep deprivation has major negative effects on the cardiovascular, endocrine, immune, and nervous systems, including the following:

- Weakens immune system
- Obesity in adults and children
- Diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance
- Cardiovascular disease and hypertension
- Increased amount of the stress hormone cortisol
- High blood pressure
- Depression, anxiety and other mental illnesses

## The Sitting Disease

If you love looking for a good scare for this Halloween season, then you might be interested in this scary fact that’s sure to get you moving!

Did you know that sitting for several hours a day puts your health at risk – even if you exercise regularly? Unfortunately, something as comfortable as sitting for too long can increase the risk of chronic health problems, so much so that sitting is now considered ‘the new smoking!’ Researchers have found that an average of 3.2 million deaths are related to physical inactivity.

## How can sitting for too long affect the body?

Prolonged sitting can increase blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and unhealthy cholesterol levels. The fact of the matter is that humans are built to stand upright, to move and be active. The heart and cardiovascular system work more effectively that way. The body’s bowel movements also function more efficiently in an upright position which is why it is common for people who are bedridden in hospital to experience problems with their bowel function.

## Terrifying Effects of Sitting Disease

1. **Cancer** - A [study in 2020](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/article-abstract/2767093) showed the relationship between inactivity and cancer mortality concluding that a sedentary lifestyle could heighten someone’s risk of later dying from cancer.

2. **Diabetes** - Research has shown that people who tend to spend more time sitting have a 112 percent higher risk of diabetes. This is because sitting can damage the body’s ability to handle blood sugar which causes a reduced sensitivity to insulin which is responsible for carrying glucose from the blood into cells where it can be used for energy.

3. **Anxiety and Depression** - Prolonged usage of gadgets as the only form of communication can cause loneliness and depression due to the lack of socialization and time spent outside. People who spend most of their time sitting also lack physical activity which can help with your mental and physical wellbeing.

4. **Back and Spine Injuries** - Sitting for a long time may promote poor posture, cause poor spine health, and can cause compression in the discs.

5. **Weakened legs and gluteals (bum muscles)** - Aside from gaining poor posture and spine health, sitting for long periods can lead to weakening and wasting away of the leg and gluteal muscles. If these muscles are weak, you are more likely to injure yourself from falls, and from strains when you do exercise.

6. **Obesity** - Since calorie burning decreases and muscles are not in use, it may cause weight gain and lead to obesity if the habit is not fixed.

7. **Heart Disease** - Obesity, insulin resistance, and fat buildup in the heart are all linked to sedentary activity, all of which can harm heart cells. Studies have shown that it increases the risk of heart disease by 64%.

# Summer Essentials Guide

It's a new year and the heat is on. To help you maximize your gains this summer, we've put together a guide of VPA's Summer Essentials; the must-have products you'll be needing this season.

## Content

### It's a new year and the heat is on. To help you maximise your gains this summer, we've put together a guide of VPA® Summer Essentials; the must-have products you'll be needing this season.

#### PROTEIN WATER
Our first summer essential is VPA® ready-to-drink Protein Water. With 30g of protein per serve, these refreshing drinks contain WPI which is quickly absorbed by the body to promote muscle tissue growth and recovery. Not to mention, they come in two mouth-watering flavours and have less than 1g of fat and carbohydrates.
If you prefer to mix up your own protein water to suit your taste, try our powdered protein water which contains WPI, collagen, BCAAs and electrolytes. Not only does it support rapid muscle recovery, but it also ensures maximum hydration for peak performance.

![Protein Water](https://i.shgcdn.com/bd453c9c-e7e9-4526-9549-52ed995dbef6/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

#### SUMMER FOMO
Summer FOMOTM is VPA®'s new and improved fat burner which contains a range of ingredients to increase metabolism, boost energy levels and suppress hunger.
The green tea extract and caffeine have a thermogenic effect, meaning that they promote fat burning to help you achieve that summer bod. Caffeine also increases reaction time and boosts energy levels to help you get the most from your workout. You'll also find L-carnitine which helps the body to burn fat more efficiently.
Summer FOMOTM also contains acacia fibre which absorbs water making you feel fuller for longer. In this way, it can assist in suppressing hunger and aid weight loss. Of course, VPA® recommends taking Summer FOMO in conjunction with a healthy diet and training program.

![Summer FOMO](https://i.shgcdn.com/cafd37a5-625b-4ed2-bcf7-3fd9742e9787/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

#### VPA® CREW SOCKS
When hitting the gym this summer, do it in style with VPA®'s Crew Socks. With a cushioned toe and heel for ultimate comfort, a high crew sock fit, and jacquard VPA® logos on both sides, you'll be turning heads in these babies.

![VPA® Crew Socks](https://i.shgcdn.com/8717ee1d-83e2-4dc0-afd0-c04661091bd1/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

#### PROTEIN PANCAKE MIX
If you're after a quick and easy breakfast this summer you can't go past VPA® Protein Pancake Mix. These pancakes are packed with over 26g of protein per serve, MCT for energy and psyllium husk for healthy digestion. Available in two delicious flavours, whether you top them with fresh fruit, yoghurt, or syrup, you are sure to love these!

![Protein Pancake Mix](https://i.shgcdn.com/757298a9-7403-47b7-aa1d-0ed7f6c202e5/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

#### CREATINE MONOHYDRATE
Finally, if you're looking to build lean muscle this bikini season, try VPA® Creatine Monohydrate. Creatine is used by muscle cells to rapidly produce energy during high-intensity and resistance exercise. For this reason, it's popular among athletes to improve performance, increase strength and power output, and to build muscle mass.

![Creatine Monohydrate](https://i.shgcdn.com/fd9582e9-6b9f-4e13-a438-54e55b79743c/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

### We love a New Year
We love a New Year as it symbolizes a fresh start and a clean slate that offers so much potential for growth and success. The result of our year is entirely up to us, and this is the reason why we take the time to reflect and come up with New Year’s Resolutions.

So, as you are coming up with amazing goals to crush like eating healthier, or losing or gaining weight, we have a few more healthy goals to consider adding to your list to make the year more enriching as well as productive.

### Quick tip: Take the time to reflect on past resolutions.
Consider what kind of goals you’re setting. This year, be mindful of how you state them and come up with actionable plans and make sure you enjoy them. Breaking up large goals like “I want to lose weight” into “I want to exercise three times a week” sets you up for success that’s within reach and reasonable.

### 1. Try a new style of fitness each month
One thing that causes most of us to fail miserably with our fitness resolutions is that we set ourselves up with routines that may work for others but may not be as enjoyable to us. Or you may have found yourself constantly plateauing easily and getting bored with the same routine that you’ve been doing for the past years.

This year, consider exploring new workout styles each month if you haven’t already. This could spark a new interest and motivate you to push yourself further than before.

#### Some activities you may want to try:
- Yoga
- Pilates
- HIIT
- Circuit Training
- Strength Training
- Cardio Training
- Weight Training

### Unlock your personal best by challenging yourself to our 8 Week Challenge for free!

### 2. Take time for self-care
Schedule regular alone times for self-care at least once a month to welcome some introspection and decompression. We are often the last person on our priority list when our lives are muddled with work and family responsibilities. Being reminded of putting yourself first can have a massive beneficial impact on your physical and mental health. You can spend time doing these activities you’ve always wanted to try but never had the time to, or simply planning a relaxing day at home for rest and enjoying a cuppa tea.

#### OUR SELF-CARE PICKS
- [Harmony Tea](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/harmony-tea)
- [Hot Protein Delight](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/hot-protein-delight)
- [Multi Greens](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/multi-greens)

### 3. Limit your screen time

### Humans are creatures of habit and once we have a good daily routine, we like to keep it, making us feel comfortable and safe. But there’s always a but - life happens, we’ve all been there and experienced changes in our life (new job, moving, starting a family, illness/injury) and subsequently our daily routine whether we like it or not, shifts. One of the first things to go when we are under pressure and trying to adapt to disruptions is our training routine. It is definitely frustrating when this happens, and it can be hard to find our happy training balance again. But there is some good news when we turn to science.

### What does Science say?
It's not all doom and gloom if we stop regular training while adapting to life changes. Findings from a [recent study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33629972/) have found “that exercise intensity seems to be the key variable for maintaining physical performance over time, despite relatively large reductions in exercise frequency and volume”. In short you can still retain your cardiovascular fitness if you can maintain your volume and intensity during your workouts, provided you can make 2 training sessions a week.

It's even better news if you are wanting to maintain your strength, the same research has found this can be retained with “as little as one workout per week and with volume lowered to one set per exercise”. But here again the intensity is crucial.

In fact, you could look at a couple of forced weeks away from your training routine as a blessing and give your body a rest and enjoy the situation. Being mindful that anything beyond 2+ weeks can lead to a decline in muscular and cardiovascular fitness overall.

### Suggested coping strategies to deal with disruptions in your training routine:
- Accept the situation and don’t stress about it
- Schedule your training routine like you would work commitments
- Look for opportunities in your everyday routine to get moving – be flexible
- Re-examine your goals and create a new challenge
- Don’t look at what your ‘old best’ was instead focus on what your ‘new best’ can be

### We've also written some blogs to help you in your fitness journey:

title: Women of VPA Australia
---

## Kathleen

This Wednesday 8th March 2023, marks 112 years since the first International Women’s Day. So, we thought, why not celebrate the women who help to make VPA® Australia an amazing place to work and provide you, our customers, with high-quality tasty supps.

We are a diverse group of women, from different backgrounds, interests, sporting ability, and education but together we make a formidable team. Let’s meet some of these women:

## Kathleen

This Advertising Major Graduate is the one who pops emails into your inbox every week updating you on all the VPA® news. Her creative flair is shown through her passion to write and create content. Her drive for learning new things about health and fitness is evident in the content she creates.

**Favourite VPA® Products:** Protein Water in Sour Worms, Protein Bars, GABA

**Health/Fitness Goal:** I've fallen in love with strength training because of VPA®. I started out with the social media manager role and absolutely loved the passion and drive everyone had in the fitness community. And when your daily programming is as lively and supportive as the VPA® Fam, you dive right in. This year, however, I'm switching up my routine and training for a focus on endurance. I'm learning all the ways to optimize and listen to my body for a good long run. I plan to run my first 1/2 marathon this year. Let's go get it!!

## Caitlin

Our Events Coordinator barely needs any introduction. This fun-loving character is the face of our VPA® TikTok's and IG Stories. Caitlin has the ability to have a chat and make everyone feel at ease, it’s a trait everyone here admires. Her love for the gym has been instrumental in some of the new VPA® accessories you will be seeing during 2023 *wink wink*.

**Favourite VPA® Products:** WPI (Vanilla and Salted Caramel), Creatine, and Venom® Pre-Workout (Sour Watermelon)

**Health/Fitness Goal:** I am very much a gym rat as they say. I have been working out since I was 18 years old. Initially, I started my fitness journey because I was insecure about how my body looked. My original goal was weight loss, which I actually didn't achieve so to say. Throughout my training journey, I fell in love with the process of building muscle and seeing just how strong I could become. I have completely changed my body composition - increasing my muscle mass and decreasing my fat mass significantly. I am now training to take my physique to the next level and naturally compete in the Wellness division at ICN in Season B, 2023.

### Proper Nutrition and Undereating

Proper nutrition is essential for maintaining optimal health and well-being. While overeating is a common concern, undereating can also have negative effects on your body and mind. Undereating occurs when you consistently consume fewer calories than your body requires, leading to potential nutrient deficiencies and imbalances. In this article, we will explore five signs that may indicate you are undereating and provide practical tips on how to address this issue.

### 1. Persistent Fatigue

One of the primary signs of undereating is persistent fatigue. When you consistently consume fewer calories than your body needs, it lacks the fuel necessary to function properly. This can lead to a constant feeling of tiredness, weakness, and difficulty concentrating. Undereating deprives your body of the energy it requires to carry out essential bodily functions, resulting in a notable decline in physical and mental performance.

Addressing fatigue caused by undereating involves ensuring you consume enough calories to meet your body's energy needs. Gradually increase your caloric intake by incorporating nutrient-dense foods such as whole grains, lean proteins, healthy fats, and a variety of fruits and vegetables into your diet. Consult a registered dietitian or nutritionist to determine the appropriate calorie intake for your specific needs.

### 2. Weight Loss and Difficulty Gaining

Undereating often leads to unintended weight loss and difficulty gaining weight. When you consistently consume fewer calories than your body requires, it turns to its energy stores, including muscle mass, to compensate for the deficit. This can result in a loss of muscle and a decrease in overall body weight, which can also be quite evident with [older adults](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/supplements/the-importance-of-protein-if-you-re-over-40).

To address weight loss and difficulty gaining weight, focus on increasing your calorie intake gradually. Include more calorie-dense foods in your diet, such as avocados, nuts, seeds, and healthy oils, as well as adding more protein to help build and retain muscle. Additionally, incorporating strength training exercises can help build muscle mass and support healthy weight gain. If you struggle with weight-related concerns, consulting a healthcare professional or registered dietitian can provide personalized guidance and support.

### When it comes to indulgent treats, dark chocolate stands out not only for its rich and decadent flavor but also for its numerous health benefits. Unlike its sweeter counterparts, dark chocolate is made from the seed of the cocoa tree and contains a higher percentage of cocoa solids. In this article, we will explore the surprising benefits of dark chocolate, backed by scientific research. From heart health to mood enhancement, dark chocolate proves to be more than just a delightful treat.

#### Rich in Antioxidants
Dark chocolate is packed with powerful antioxidants known as flavonoids. These antioxidants help protect the body against free radicals; harmful compounds that can cause oxidative damage to cells. The high concentration of flavonoids in dark chocolate contributes to its potent antioxidant activity, which can help reduce inflammation, promote healthy aging, and lower the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and certain types of cancer.

![Dark Chocolate](https://i.shgcdn.com/7222af29-a707-4eea-b55a-564982769ceb/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

#### Heart Health Boost
Regular consumption of dark chocolate has been linked to several heart-healthy benefits. The flavonoids present in dark chocolate may improve heart health by reducing blood pressure, increasing blood flow, and enhancing the flexibility of blood vessels. Studies suggest that dark chocolate can help lower the risk of heart disease, reduce LDL cholesterol levels, and improve overall cardiovascular function.

#### Mood Enhancement
Dark chocolate is often touted as a mood booster, and for good reason. It contains compounds that stimulate the production of endorphins, the feel-good chemicals in the brain. Additionally, dark chocolate contains a small amount of caffeine and a compound called theobromine, which can provide a mild energy boost and enhance mental alertness. Moreover, dark chocolate may have a positive impact on mood and stress levels. It can stimulate the release of serotonin; a neurotransmitter associated with feelings of happiness and well-being. Studies have shown that regular consumption of dark chocolate can help reduce stress and improve overall mood.

### Are your supplements third-party tested? They should be.

In the world of dietary supplements, the role of third-party testing in supplements cannot be overstated. Third-party testing supplements play a crucial role in ensuring the safety, quality, and efficacy of the product. It provides consumers with transparency, trustworthiness, and peace of mind knowing that the products they are consuming have undergone rigorous testing.

Unfortunately, it is easy for companies to cut corners on quality control and end up with a product that doesn't match the claims and ingredients on their label. In this article, we will explore the reasons why third-party testing for supplements is important.

---

#### Why is third-party testing important for supplements?

Third-party testing is vital for supplements because it ensures that the products are safe for consumption. When a product is third-party tested, it means the products have undergone testing conducted by a company that is not involved in the production or sale of the supplement.

By subjecting supplements to independent testing, manufacturers can identify and eliminate any contaminants or harmful substances that may be present. This testing process provides an additional layer of protection for consumers, allowing them to make informed decisions about the products they choose to use.

- Third-party testing ensures that suppliers’ products meet the highest quality standards.
- Third-party testing ensures that companies adhere to manufacturing processes and strict guidelines.
- Third-party testing verifies the accuracy of labeling on supplements.
- Third-party testing prevents misleading claims and helps consumers choose supplements that align with their specific needs.

It creates a level playing field, where all manufacturers must adhere to the same testing standards. This encourages companies to prioritize the quality and safety of their products, ultimately benefiting the consumers.

So, are your supplements third-party tested? It’s time to choose wisely.

## Biological Rhythms

Biological rhythms are the natural cycles that regulate various physiological processes in living organisms. These rhythms are innate and follow specific patterns, often influenced by external cues such as light, temperature, and social interactions. Among the various biological rhythms, two prominent ones are the circadian rhythm and the infradian rhythm. These rhythms play crucial roles in our daily lives, affecting everything from sleep-wake cycles to reproductive patterns. In this article, we discuss the intricacies of these rhythms, exploring their mechanisms, significance, and how they impact human health.

## Circadian Rhythm: Nature's Internal Clock

The circadian rhythm is perhaps the most well-known biological rhythm, often referred to as the body's internal clock. Derived from the Latin words "circa" (around) and "diem" (day), circadian rhythms operate on a roughly 24-hour cycle. These rhythms are driven by a group of specialized cells in the brain's hypothalamus called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN acts as the master pacemaker, receiving input from light-sensitive cells in the retina that detect changes in light intensity.

The primary function of the circadian rhythm is to synchronize physiological and behavioral processes with the Earth’s day-night cycle. This synchronization ensures optimal functioning and efficiency across a wide range of bodily functions. Sleep-wake cycles, hormone production, body temperature regulation, and even cognitive performance exhibit circadian patterns.

## Mechanisms Behind Circadian Rhythms

The mechanisms governing circadian rhythms are intricate and involve a network of genes and proteins. The core molecular components of the circadian clock include "clock" genes (e.g., CLOCK and BMAL1) and their protein products. These genes work in a feedback loop, where they activate the production of proteins that, in turn, suppress their own activity. This cycle takes approximately 24 hours to complete, aligning with the duration of a circadian rhythm.

External cues, particularly light, play a pivotal role in synchronizing the circadian rhythm. Light exposure, particularly blue light, suppresses the production of the hormone melatonin, which helps regulate sleep. This is why exposure to bright light during the day helps maintain a proper sleep-wake cycle. Conversely, lower light levels in the evening signal the body to start producing melatonin, facilitating the transition into sleep.

## Impact on Health & Well-Being

Maintaining a balanced circadian rhythm is essential for overall health and well-being. Disruptions to this rhythm, such as those caused by shift work, jet lag, or irregular sleep patterns, can lead to a phenomenon known as circadian desynchronization. This disruption has been linked to a range of health issues, including sleep disorders, mood disorders, metabolic disturbances, and even an increased risk of certain chronic diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular problems.

Researchers and medical professionals are increasingly recognizing the importance of circadian rhythms in optimizing treatment strategies. Chronotherapy, for instance, involves timing medical interventions according to the patient's circadian rhythms to enhance treatment effectiveness and minimize side effects.

## When we talk about working out, it's clear that your gym sessions matter. But let's not forget what happens beyond those gym walls—what you put in your body, how you hydrate, and, of course, the quality of your sleep.

## Here's the scoop: Getting a good night's sleep is an absolute must if you want your exercise efforts to pay off effectively.

The connection between diet, exercise, and sleep is like a well-choreographed dance—they're all intertwined and affect each other. These three pieces of the healthy living puzzle work together to shape your overall well-being.

---

## The Relationship Between Sleep, Diet, and Exercise

### Diet and Exercise:

Energy Balance: Diet and exercise are key components in regulating your energy balance. The calories you consume through your diet provide the energy needed for physical activity. If you consistently consume more calories than you burn through exercise and daily activities, you may gain weight. Conversely, if you burn more calories than you consume, you may lose weight.

Nutrient Intake: Proper nutrition is essential to support exercise performance and recovery. Carbohydrates provide energy for workouts, protein aids in muscle repair and growth, and fats are necessary for overall health. A well-balanced diet ensures you have the nutrients needed for optimal exercise performance.

Hydration: Staying hydrated is crucial for exercise, as even mild dehydration can impair physical performance. Proper fluid intake through your diet (water-rich foods) and drinking fluids is essential for both exercise and overall health.

---

### Exercise and Sleep

Quality of Sleep: Regular exercise can improve the quality of your sleep. Engaging in physical activity can help you fall asleep faster, enjoy deeper sleep, and experience fewer disruptions during the night. However, vigorous exercise too close to bedtime can sometimes interfere with sleep, so timing is important.

Sleep Regulation: Exercise helps regulate your circadian rhythm, which plays a significant role in your sleep-wake cycle. Exposure to natural light and physical activity during the day can help synchronize your body's internal clock, promoting better sleep patterns.

Stress Reduction: Exercise can reduce stress and anxiety, which can lead to improved sleep. Stress is a common disruptor of sleep, and regular physical activity can help manage stress levels.

---

### Diet and Sleep

Food Choices and Timing: The foods you consume and when you eat can affect your sleep. Large, heavy meals close to bedtime can lead to discomfort and indigestion, making it harder to fall asleep. It's generally recommended to have a lighter meal a few hours before bedtime.

Caffeine and Alcohol: Consuming caffeine or alcohol, especially in the evening, can interfere with sleep quality. Caffeine is a stimulant that can make it difficult to fall asleep, while alcohol can disrupt the sleep cycle, leading to poorer sleep quality.

Nutrient Deficiencies: Certain nutrients, such as magnesium and melatonin, can influence sleep. Diets lacking these nutrients may lead to sleep disturbances. Including foods rich in these nutrients in your diet can potentially improve sleep.

### Preparing for a Fitness Challenge

Preparing for a fitness challenge requires careful planning and commitment to ensure you can meet your goals safely and effectively. Here are steps to help you prepare for a fitness challenge:

#### Set Clear Goals
Determine what you want to achieve in the fitness challenge. Make your goals specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound [SMART](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/success-with-smart-goal-setting), as mentioned in the previous answer. For example, you might aim to lose a certain amount of weight, run a specific distance, or improve your strength or endurance.

#### Assess Your Current Fitness Level
Before you begin, evaluate your current fitness level. This can help you gauge where you are starting from and track your progress throughout the challenge. You can do this by measuring your weight, taking body measurements, recording your current fitness abilities, and even getting a fitness assessment from a professional if possible.

#### Plan Your Exercise Routine
Based on your goals, create a structured exercise plan that includes a mix of cardiovascular (e.g., running, cycling), strength training (e.g., weightlifting, bodyweight exercises), and flexibility exercises (e.g., stretching, yoga). Consider the frequency, intensity, and duration of your workouts. Gradually increase the intensity to avoid injury.

#### Nutrition Planning
Proper nutrition is a crucial part of any fitness challenge. Calculate your daily caloric needs and design a balanced diet that supports your goals. Focus on whole foods, lean proteins, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. You may also want to consult a registered dietitian for personalized guidance.

#### Hydration
Staying hydrated is essential for optimal performance and recovery. Drink plenty of water throughout the day, especially before, during, and after your workouts.

#### Track Your Progress
Use a fitness journal or smartphone app to record your workouts, diet, and any changes in your measurements, weight, or performance. Tracking your progress can help you stay motivated and make adjustments as needed.

#### Adapt and Adjust
Be prepared to adjust your plan if necessary. Listen to your body and make modifications if you experience pain, discomfort, or other health issues. Flexibility in your approach can help you avoid setbacks.

#### Seek Support and Accountability
Share your fitness challenge with friends, family, or a fitness buddy. Having someone to encourage you and hold you accountable can be highly motivating. You can also consider joining a fitness group or participating in an organized challenge where you can connect with others with similar goals.

#### Stay Consistent
Consistency is key to achieving your fitness goals. Stick to your exercise routine and nutrition plan even on days when motivation is low. Creating habits and routines can help you stay on track.

#### Recovery and Rest
Don't overlook the importance of rest and recovery. Ensure you get enough sleep, as it plays a vital role in muscle repair and overall well-being. Incorporate rest days into your exercise plan to prevent burnout and reduce the risk of injury.

#### Celebrate Milestones
Recognize and celebrate your achievements along the way. Whether it's hitting a weight loss target, running a certain distance, or lifting a new weight, acknowledging your progress can boost motivation.

#### Stay Safe
Always prioritize safety during your fitness challenge. Warm up properly before workouts, use proper form during exercises, and consult with a healthcare professional if you have any underlying health concerns.

### SMART Goal Planning

**SMART** is an acronym that stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. It's a widely used framework for setting and achieving goals effectively. Let's break down each component of **SMART goal planning**:

---

#### Specific

Your goal should be clear and well-defined. Avoid vague or general goals. Ask yourself the following questions to make your goal specific:

- What exactly do I want to accomplish?
- Why is this goal important?
- Who is involved?
- Where will it happen?
- What are the constraints or limitations?

**Example of a specific goal:** "I want to lose 20 pounds by following a balanced diet and exercising regularly over the next six months."

---

#### Measurable

You should be able to track your progress and measure your success. Include specific criteria or metrics to quantify your goal.

- How will you measure your progress?
- How will you know when you've achieved your goal?

**Example of a measurable goal:** "I will track my weight each week and aim to lose 1-2 pounds per week until I reach a total weight loss of 20 pounds."

---

#### Achievable

Your goal should be realistic and attainable given your current circumstances and resources. It should challenge you but not be so far-fetched that it's impossible to reach.

- Is this goal possible for me to achieve?
- Do I have the necessary resources and support?

**Example of an achievable goal:** "Given my current schedule and access to a gym, I can realistically commit to exercising for 30 minutes, five days a week."

## WHO IS CAITY G?

Caity G is VPA’s Events and Social Media Manager. Caity joined the VPA team back in November 2021 and since then she has continued to grow her presence within the business and create a lasting impression on the VPA Community.

You may have come across Caity on the VPA Social Media, whether that be one of her epic community events, ads, or hilarious reels.

Caity places a significant emphasis on her passion for growing an unstoppable community. A highlight in her role, she says, is her ability to bring people together and celebrate everyone in the fitness community through her epic Events. Caity also works largely within the marketing team and plays a significant role in creating campaigns and bringing them to life via Social Media.

She is a right-hand girl for just about anything with her can-do attitude, there is no challenge too big for her… hence why on top of being an absolute superstar at VPA she took on the challenge of Powerlifting and Bodybuilding – here’s her story.

## BACKGROUND

Caity G’s gym journey stems back to 2019 when she decided to transform her lifestyle and sign up for the gym. Caity’s reasoning for joining the gym stemmed from a place of insecurity and simply not feeling confident in the way she looked, especially after moving from her small rural country town, Winton, to the big smoke, Brisbane, for university where she had endless options of food delicacy to choose from. Caitlin’s relationship with food and body image took a turn for the worse.

As we are sure so many of you can relate, Caity for months was terrified of the weights section in the gym and for months she spent tireless hours doing only ab-circuits followed by running for kilometers around her neighborhood to try and burn the weight off.

After a good 6 months of being in a back and forth relationship with the ab-circuits and cardio machines, she finally built up the courage to step into the weights room. Then COVID hit…

As you know, during this time gyms shutdown for the foreseeable future. Caity was determined to not let it slow her progress. She took full advantage of the only being allowed to go outside for essential activities which of course, included exercise. She went for a 10-kilometer run nearly every single day of COVID lockdown.

Unfortunately, during this time Caity did develop another unhealthy relationship with food. As you may be aware, during this time the infamous 1200-calorie diet began to trend on platforms such as TikTok. Admittedly, being uneducated in both nutrition and the basic nutrients that the body needs to function, this led to more complications with Caity’s eating habits including binging. Caity would under fuel her body during the week which lead to binging episodes on the weekend. This felt like a never-ending repeating cycle.

Fast forward to post COVID, Caity had decided she wouldn’t let her fear of the weights room hinder her progress in the gym any longer. She didn’t have much knowledge about the gym and which exercises would be the most beneficial to her goal, which was to lose weight and put on muscle at the same time (in hindsight, she knows just how silly this goal is). Caity, did however have a TikTok and Instagram account and that's where she would find her inspiration for her workouts. To her own surprise, she put on quite a bit of muscle.

Fast forward again to February 2022, the grand opening of World Gym Stafford. Caity signed up to this flash new hub for Bodybuilders and decided to invest in a coach. Unfortunately, at the time budget only allowed for a training program and not the nutrition side of things (again, thank god for the internet).

If you know Caity, with the level of intensity, determination and intention she puts into every single one of her sessions, that was all she needed to see her strength skyrocket. Caity G is actually known for training negative 3RIR.

# Importance of Diaphragmatic Breathing

Learn about the importance of diaphragmatic breathing and discover diaphragmatic breathing exercises to improve your breathing technique.

---

## Content

Sometimes, it's the simplest things that have the most profound impact on our health and well-being. Diaphragmatic breathing, also known as belly or abdominal breathing, is one such practice that engages your diaphragm, an important large muscle located between your chest and abdomen, to breathe deeply and efficiently.

It also offers numerous benefits including enhanced lung function, cardiovascular health, and stress management.

### But what exactly is belly breathing, and how does it differ from regular shallow breathing?

Shallow breathing primarily involves the chest and upper body, leaving the diaphragm – your most efficient breathing muscle – largely unengaged.

- **Diaphragmatic breathing**, on the other hand, harnesses the power of the diaphragm, leading to deeper and more efficient breaths. The physiological processes involved in belly breathing are fascinating to explore.

When you engage in this practice, you actively engage your diaphragm and abdominal muscles. This facilitates a fuller expansion of the lungs, optimizing oxygen intake, and allowing for a more efficient release of carbon dioxide.

---

### Diaphragmatic Breathing Exercises

There are several diaphragmatic breathing exercises that can help you practice and improve your diaphragmatic breathing technique. Here are a few examples along with their steps:

#### 1. BASIC DIAPHRAGMATIC EXERCISE:

This exercise is a simple way to start practicing diaphragmatic breathing.

- Find a quiet and comfortable place to sit or lie down.
- Place one hand on your chest and the other on your abdomen.
- Inhale slowly through your nose, focusing on filling your abdomen with air. Feel your hand on your abdomen rise as you do this.
- Exhale slowly and completely through your mouth, allowing your abdomen to fall.

## Content

In the ever-evolving world of health and wellness, a new form of exercise has been steadily gaining prominence: somatic workouts. Born out of the belief that the mind and body are inextricably linked, somatic exercises offer a uniquely comprehensive approach to fitness and well-being.

Somatic workouts, also known as somatic movement, involve performing specific, conscious movements that allow us to tap into our body's natural ability to heal and self-correct. These exercises provide a deep level of body awareness and proprioception, enabling us to identify and release chronic tension and stress trapped in our muscles.

## What is the science behind somatic workouts?

What role does the nervous system play in these exercises? Research shows that somatic workouts target the nervous system to help correct imbalances and dysfunctional movement patterns. By focusing on the internal experience of movement, these exercises facilitate communication between the mind and body, enhancing control over our muscles and movements. This unique focus on the nervous system is what makes somatic workouts particularly beneficial for stress reduction and mental relaxation.

## Who should do somatic workouts?

Generally, anyone can benefit from doing somatic exercises however these would be a great addition for those who experience symptoms of chronic stress, tension, and painful conditions such as lower back pain, neck pain, fibromyalgia, and sciatica. These exercises can help release muscle tension and improve posture, potentially reducing pain over time.

Somatic exercise is also great for the aging population as it helps older adults maintain and regain mobility, reduce stiffness and enhance their overall quality of life.

## What are the benefits of somatic workouts?

- **Improved Body Awareness:** Somatic exercises emphasise mindfulness and proprioception, helping individuals become more aware of their bodies, movement patterns, and areas of tension or discomfort.
- **Reduced Muscle Tension and Pain:** Somatic movements can release chronic muscle tension and alleviate pain by promoting relaxation and improved muscle function.
- **Enhanced Flexibility and Range of Motion:** Somatic workouts often incorporate gentle stretching and movement sequences that can increase flexibility and improve joint mobility.
- **Stress Reduction:** The mindful and slow-paced nature of somatic exercises can help reduce stress and promote relaxation, leading to lower cortisol levels and improved mental well-being.
- **Better Posture:** Somatic workouts can correct poor posture habits by retraining the neuromuscular system to maintain a balanced and aligned posture.
- **Injury Prevention:** By addressing muscular imbalances and promoting better movement patterns, somatic exercises can reduce the risk of injuries related to muscle strains, joint issues, and overuse.
- **Increased Body Control:** Somatic movements can enhance your ability to control and coordinate your body's movements, which can be beneficial for athletes, dancers, and anyone looking to improve their physical performance.
- **Enhanced Breathing:** Somatic exercises often incorporate breath awareness and control, which can lead to improved respiratory function and greater oxygenation of tissues.
- **Mind-Body Connection:** Somatic workouts promote a strong connection between the mind and body, fostering a sense of mindfulness and self-awareness that can extend beyond the exercise routine into daily life.
- **Holistic Approach:** Somatics takes a holistic approach to health and well-being, addressing both the physical and mental aspects of wellness. This can lead to a more balanced and integrated sense of self.

We've all been there. You decide to overhaul your life overnight, pledging to eat nothing but kale and hit the gym every day. You're going strong for a week or two, but then life happens, and you find yourself face-first in a pizza box, feeling like a failure. 

It's time to ditch the "all or nothing" approach to health and fitness and embrace a more balanced and sustainable lifestyle. In this article, we'll explore some easy-to-follow tips on building healthy habits to make sure we’re counting more wins than losses this year.

## 1. Start Small, Really Small

The first rule for building healthy habits is to start small. Like, minuscule small. Instead of aiming for a complete diet overhaul, try incorporating a single healthy habit into your daily routine. This could be as simple as swapping out your morning doughnut for a piece of fruit or taking a 10-minute walk during your lunch break. Small changes are easier to stick with and can lead to big results over time.

### Bad habits

Bad habits are formed out of routines that give us immediate pleasure. Think, doom scrolling on social media – easy and low commitment as opposed to actual learning or working on things that actually matter to you.

The [National Institutes of Health](https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2012/01/breaking-bad-habits#:~:text=Habits%20can%20also%20develop%20when,of%20computers%20and%20social%20media) say that these bad habits activate the brain’s reward system. They make us feel good by releasing dopamine, a chemical in the brain. This can create a loop where we keep doing the same thing to get more dopamine.

But bad habits can have negative effects on our physical or mental health over time. They can also lower our productivity.

## 2. Consistency Trumps Intensity

Gone are the days of pushing yourself to the brink of exhaustion during workouts or surviving on salads alone. Consistency is the name of the game. Opt for regular and manageable changes to your routine to make sure you can realistically keep them up. Whether it's a daily walk, a weekly dance class, or yoga sessions, find what works for you and stick to it. It's the steady effort that wins the race.

## 3. Make Things Enjoyable

Whatever the goal, it helps to find ways to make it exciting rather than a dreaded chore. For example, if you’re building on the habit of consistently exercising, find an activity you genuinely enjoy, and you'll be more likely to stick with it. Love dancing? Take up dance classes. Enjoy the great outdoors? Try hiking or biking. When exercise becomes a fun part of your life, it's no longer a burden.

Here are some other ideas up on our sleeve:

- **Cleaning the house** – blast some music while you’re at it and bop to your favourite tunes!
- **Staying hydrated** – keep your cool and trusty [VPA 1L Insulated water bottle](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/1l-insulated-drink-bottle) beside you at work to remind you to keep hydrated throughout the day.
- **Fight doom scrolling** – find productivity apps that lock certain apps (Eep!) for a period of time. Set it your way, of course. This is certainly very useful at work. Your boss will love it for you. *wink

Get tips for safe sun exposure and more. Read on!

---

## Content

In the hustle and bustle of modern life, it's easy to overlook the simple yet profound benefits of something as basic as sunlight. Specifically, the gentle rays of the morning sun have a remarkable impact on our well-being, both physically and mentally. Beyond just illuminating our surroundings, morning sunlight offers a host of benefits that can enhance our mood, improve our health, and invigorate our daily routines.

## What are the health benefits of morning sunlight?

### Morning sun exposure boosts the immune system
Morning sun exposure can boost our immune system primarily through the synthesis of vitamin D. Sunlight is the most potent source of Vitamin D, a nutrient vital for healthy bones and teeth. When our skin is exposed to sunlight, specifically ultraviolet B (UVB) rays, it triggers a process in which cholesterol in the skin is converted into vitamin D. Vitamin D is a crucial nutrient that plays a central role in immune function.

### Morning sun is a natural mood enhancer
Sunlight exposure, particularly during the morning hours, is closely linked to the production and regulation of serotonin in the body. Sunlight enters the eyes and triggers a series of biochemical reactions that lead to the release of serotonin from specialised cells known as serotonergic neurons. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter, often referred to as the "feel-good" hormone, that plays a crucial role in regulating mood, appetite, sleep, and cognitive functions. The impact of the lack of sun exposure is closely linked to [Seasonal Affective Disorder](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4673349/).

### Morning sun exposure helps regulate the body's Circadian Rhythm
Sunlight exposure helps regulate the body's internal clock, known as the [circadian rhythm](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/understanding-biological-rhythms-circadian-rhythm-vs-infradian-rhythm). Sun exposure helps synchronise the circadian rhythm, signalling to the body that it's time to wake up and start the day. This synchronisation of the circadian rhythm is crucial for maintaining optimal serotonin levels and promoting overall well-being.

### Morning sunlight in lowering blood pressure
Recent studies have shown that morning sunlight can help [lower blood pressure.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2290997/) The skin exposed to sunlight releases a compound called nitric oxide into the bloodstream, which can lower blood pressure levels.

### The Correlation Between Morning Sunlight and Weight Loss
Morning sunlight or Vitamin D can also help in maintaining a healthy weight. A study has shown that exposure to early morning sunlight was found to reduce the risk of developing obesity and cardiometabolic dysfunction. As the blue-light wavelength permeates our skin and reaches the fat beneath, lipid droplets diminish and exit the cells. Essentially, sunlight aids in eliminating excess body fat. A shortage of this essential component is also associated with obesity. Furthermore, the correlation is evident as individuals tend to gain more weight in the winter months due to diminished UV ray exposure.

# Discover the Benefits of Outdoor Workouts in the Winter Sun

Explore the benefits of outdoor workouts in the winter sun with VPA's guide to outback adventure fitness. Stay fit and safe while enjoying the great outdoors!

---

## Content

# While the allure of a toasty gym might be strong as the winter chill sets in, there's a whole world of fitness waiting for you just outside your door. We're talking about the great Aussie outback, folks! Swap the treadmill monotony for scenic trails, ditch the weights for tree trunks (metaphorically, of course), and turn your winter workout into an unforgettable outback adventure.

## Why Outback Workouts Rock in Winter?

Let's face it, winter gym sessions can feel a bit like battling the crowds for a sweaty metal throne. But the outback in winter? It's a different story. Imagine this: crisp mornings, clear skies, and the golden glow of winter sun filtering through the trees. Sounds pretty darn invigorating, right?

**Here's the science bit:** sunshine equals Vitamin D, which not only keeps your bones strong but also helps boost your mood – perfect for those winter blues. Plus, exercising outdoors exposes you to fresh air, which can improve lung function and leave you feeling energised.

---

## Outback Adventure Workouts: Your Winter Fitness Toolkit

Now that we've convinced you to ditch the gym and embrace the outback, let's get down to the nitty-gritty. Here are some awesome workouts that'll have you getting fit while exploring the beauty of the Australian winter:

- **Bushwalking Blitz:** Lace up your boots and hit the trails! Winter is prime time for bushwalking, with cooler temperatures making longer hikes more enjoyable. Think of it as a moving meditation – fresh air, scenic views, and a workout that'll challenge your legs, core, and cardiovascular system. Remember, winter mornings can be crisp, so pack some layers you can shed as you warm up.

![Snowy Mountains Region, New South Wales](https://i.shgcdn.com/b1d3e2ff-9a08-4ba6-a3d2-2edab9de3925/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

**Bushwalking Bonus:** Keep an eye out for native wildlife! Spotting kangaroos, wallabies, or even an echidna adds a whole new layer of excitement to your workout.

---

- **Trail Running Thrill:** For the runners out there, trail running takes city running and even bushwalking to the next level. Uneven terrain, inclines, and declines will test your balance and agility, while the fresh air keeps your lungs pumping. It's a fantastic way to build endurance and strength, all while taking in the sights of the outback.

![Trail Running Image](https://i.shgcdn.com/9d216f16-dc54-4e84-bb8e-ced76022ffb4/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

**Trail Running Tip:** Safety first! Let someone know your planned route and stick to well-marked trails, especially for your first few winter trail runs. And we like to pump it up with a yummy pre-workout!

---

- **Nature's Gym:** The beauty of the outback is that it's your very own open-air gym. Look around and get creative! Use sturdy tree branches for pull-ups, large rocks for lunges and squats, and fallen logs for step-ups. You can even incorporate some animal movements – think squats low to the ground like a frog, or high knees like a bounding wallaby.

**Nature's Gym Challenge:** Find a big, sturdy rock and challenge yourself to a timed plank hold. The fresh air and scenery will make those core muscles burn in the best way possible!

---

- **Stargazing Yoga:** Combine the serenity of winter nights with a relaxing yoga session. Find a clear spot away from light pollution, lay down your mat, and let the vastness of the outback sky inspire you. Winter nights can get chilly, so dress warmly and bring a blanket for extra comfort.

**Stargazing Yoga Bonus:** Download a stargazing app and use it to identify constellations as you relax and unwind.

Discover the key factors affecting your metabolism and strategies to optimize your metabolic health. Learn how to fuel your body right and move regularly for peak performance.

---

## Content

Let's face it, you train hard. You push your limits in the gym, sweat it out on the track, and prioritise a healthy diet. But are you optimising your body's engine – your metabolism – to get the most out of your efforts?

[Metabolic health](https://www.bupa.co.uk/newsroom/ourviews/metabolic-health), a term that has garnered increased attention in recent years, plays a crucial role in our overall wellbeing. But what exactly is metabolic health, and why is it so important?

Metabolic health refers to how efficiently your body processes energy from food. It impacts everything from weight management and blood sugar control to energy levels and recovery. So, for the fitness enthusiast seeking peak performance and long-term health, optimising metabolic health is a game-changer.

This article dives into the fundamentals of metabolic health, providing actionable strategies you can incorporate into your routine, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

## Why It Matters: The Perks of Peak Metabolism

Think of your metabolism as your internal furnace, burning fuel (food) to generate energy (ATP) for your body's functions. Efficient metabolic function translates to:

- **Better Blood Sugar Control:** Stable blood sugar levels prevent energy crashes and cravings, keeping you focused and fueled during workouts.
- **Enhanced Fat Burning:** A well-tuned metabolism helps your body utilise stored fat for energy, aiding weight management and promoting lean muscle mass.
- **Improved Energy Levels:** Consistent energy delivery throughout the day translates to better performance in the gym and a more active lifestyle.
- **Faster Recovery:** Efficient nutrient uptake and utilisation accelerates post-workout recovery, allowing you to bounce back stronger.
- **Reduced Disease Risk:** Studies suggest a link between poor metabolic health and chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Optimising your metabolism can lower your risk.

## The Key Players: Factors Affecting Your Metabolism

Factors influence your metabolic rate, some beyond your control like genetics and age. However, the good news is that you have significant power to optimise it through lifestyle choices. Here are the key players:

- **Diet:** What and how you eat plays a major role. Refined carbohydrates, sugary drinks, and unhealthy fats can wreak havoc on your blood sugar and metabolic function.
- **Exercise:** Regular physical activity, particularly strength training, builds muscle mass which has a higher metabolic rate than fat tissue.
- **Sleep:** When you're sleep-deprived, your body produces more stress hormones that can disrupt metabolism. Aim for 7-8 hours of quality sleep nightly.
- **Stress Management:** Chronic stress elevates cortisol, a hormone known to promote fat storage and hinder metabolism. Relaxation techniques like yoga or meditation can help.

## The Action Plan: Strategies to Optimise Your Metabolic Health

Now that you understand the importance and key influencers of metabolic health, let's get tactical. Here are actionable strategies to put into practice:

### Fuel Your Body Right

- **Prioritise whole, unprocessed foods:** Focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats like those found in nuts, seeds, and olive oil.
- **Limit refined carbohydrates and added sugars:** These foods cause blood sugar spikes and crashes, disrupting your metabolism. Opt for complex carbohydrates found in whole grains.
- **Include protein at every meal:** Protein helps with satiety and muscle building, both beneficial for metabolic health.
- **Don't fear healthy fats:** Contrary to popular belief, healthy fats are essential for hormone regulation and cellular function.
- **Consider portion control:** Even healthy foods can lead to weight gain if consumed in excess.

**SEO Title:** The Power of V02max: Why Boosting Your VO2 Max is a Fitness Gamechanger

**SEO Description:** N/A

---

## Excerpt

Discover the importance of boosting your VO2 Max for fitness and performance. Learn how to enhance your endurance and overall health with VPA's featured articles.

---

## Content

## We all crave that feeling of pushing our limits, conquering workouts, and leaving breathlessness in the dust. But what if there was a key metric that could unlock a whole new level of physical performance? If you're an athlete or fitness enthusiast, chances are you've heard of V02max. But what exactly is V02max, and why is it so crucial to boosting endurance?  

In this article, we'll explore the reasons why boosting it should be a top priority for anyone serious about fitness. We'll break down the science, highlight the benefits, and equip you with practical tips to supercharge your workouts and reach your full potential.

### What is VO2max?

VO2 max stands for maximum oxygen uptake. It represents the highest amount of oxygen your body can use during intense exercise. It is a key indicator of your cardiovascular fitness and aerobic endurance. Think of it like the engine size of your fitness machine: the bigger the engine, the more efficiently it burns fuel (oxygen) to generate power (energy).  

### Here's the science breakdown:

Understanding the biochemistry behind V02max can be fascinating. During exercise, your muscles demand more oxygen to produce more energy. Your lungs, heart, and circulatory system work in overdrive to deliver that oxygen. VO2 max reflects this peak capacity, measured in millilitres of oxygen consumed per kilogramme of body weight per minute (ml/kg/min).

### Why Should You Care About VO2max?

#### Here's the exciting part: a higher VO2 max translates into a multitude of benefits for your fitness journey:  

- **Endurance Powerhouse:** [Studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10647532/) have shown a clear link between VO2 max and endurance performance. A higher VO2 max allows your body to sustain a higher intensity for longer durations, making those long runs or challenging HIIT workouts feel less daunting.  
- **Improved Recovery:** Imagine recovering faster and bouncing back quicker for your next training session. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3438148/) suggests a positive correlation between VO2 max and an improved lactate threshold. Lactate is a byproduct of exercise that can lead to fatigue. A higher VO2 max allows your body to buffer lactate more effectively, delaying muscle fatigue and speeding up recovery.  
- **Fat Burning Machine:** Want to optimise your fat-burning potential? Look no further than VO2 max. [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2278845/) have shown that exercise intensity directly impacts fat utilisation. As your VO2 max increases, your body becomes more efficient at burning fat for fuel during exercise.  

- **Stronger Heart, Healthier You:** In a clinical setting, V02max is often used to monitor heart conditions. Studies have shown that increasing V02max can help manage heart conditions by improving cardiovascular health and endurance. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK241309/) indicates a link between higher VO2 max and a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and even certain cancers. Boosting your VO2 max is an investment in your long-term health.  
- **Daily Life Boost:** The benefits extend beyond the gym. A higher VO2 max translates to improved daily activities. Imagine climbing stairs without feeling winded or having more energy for playing with your kids. Even simple tasks become easier with a more efficient oxygen delivery system.  

Real-world case studies further illustrate how increasing V02max can transform lives and athletic careers. Many elite athletes, from runners to cyclists, attribute their success to focused V02max training.  

### So, how can we improve our V02max for better athletic performance?

Now that you're convinced about the power of VO2 max, let's explore how to turn the key and unleash your full potential:

## The Truth About Fat-Burning Zones

Have you ever wondered what the best heart rate to burn fat is? Your body burns calories to produce energy, but did you know that the intensity of your workout can determine whether those calories come from carbohydrates or fat? Yes, this is where the concept of fat-burning zones comes into play.

We've all heard the whispers of the magic "fat-burning zone," a theory suggesting a particular heart rate range where your body uses more fat than carbohydrates for fuel. This mythical land of exercise supposedly maximises calorie burn and melts fat away. But is there truth to the legend, and if so, what heart rate should you target? Buckle up, fitness enthusiasts, because we're diving deep into the science of heart rate zones and how they impact your physique and health.

The good news is that fat-burning zones are real! They correspond to different intensities of exercise, measured by your heart rate. Here's a breakdown of the three main zones:

### Moderate-Intensity (50–70% of Maximum Heart Rate):

This zone, often referred to as the "fat-burning zone," feels comfortable. Many believe that higher-intensity workouts burn more fat, but that's not entirely true. When you exercise at around 60–70% of your maximum heart rate, you allow your body to draw energy primarily from fat stores, optimising fat loss. You can hold a conversation, but you're working up a sweat. Studies suggest your body uses a mix of fat and carbohydrates for fuel. Think brisk walking, jogging at an easy pace, or cycling on flat terrain.

### Vigorous intensity (70–85% of maximum heart rate):

Buckle up! This zone pushes you harder. Conversation becomes difficult, and you're breathing heavily. Here, your body relies more on carbohydrates for immediate energy, but the afterburn effect is significant. You continue to burn calories even after your workout ends—a double win! Activities like high-intensity interval training (HIIT), sprinting, or intense swimming fall into this zone.

### Maximum-Intensity (85%+ of Maximum Heart Rate):

This zone is all-out effort for short bursts. Think sprinting or lifting the heaviest weights you can manage for a few reps. While it burns a ton of calories during the activity, the window of fat burning is shorter.

### Factors Influencing the 'Best' Heart Rate for Fat Burning

Several factors dictate your optimal heart rate for fat burning. These include age, gender, fitness level, and genetics. However, everyone has a unique 'best' heart rate to burn fat, which can be calculated and optimized for maximum fat loss.

There are two main ways to calculate your heart rate zones:

1. Using your maximum heart rate (MHR):

This is a traditional method and a good starting point. While not completely personalized, it gives you a general idea of each zone. Here's how to find your MHR:
