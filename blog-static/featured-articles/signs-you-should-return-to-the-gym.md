# Reasons to Return to the Gym

Now, if I saw this headline, I’d skip the post immediately and you probably would too. Why? Because none of us want the unsolicited advice of a random stranger telling us whether we should go back to the gym or not. However, this could be incredibly helpful to a lot of people and might be the push you need to return.

## #1 You're not getting stronger

When it comes to fitness, the goal is to get stronger. As you add weight to the bar, your muscles have to work harder and harder to complete the lift. This progressive overload is the key to achieving your goals and building a strong body.

What if you're not getting stronger? Does this mean that your home workouts are not working? Well, yeah, probably because you may not have access to different types of equipment that will level up your workout. Thankfully, you can have access to these types of equipment at the gym.

If this is the case, then it might be time to go back. There are a lot of benefits to returning. One is meeting people who can help you, especially trainers. Another advantage is the number of resources that can be found in the gym.

## #2 The days you don't workout are the ones when you feel tired/unmotivated

Most of us know that exercise is important for keeping our bodies and minds healthy. But let's be honest, sometimes it can seem more like a chore than a treat. That's why we've rounded up the things you should look for to tell whether or not it's time to go back to the gym. First, let's look at what happens when your body isn't getting any exercise.

**Tiredness:** No one likes to feel tired all of the time, but if you're not getting the recommended amount of exercise every week, you can bet that you'll feel lethargic during your waking hours. If you haven't been exercising lately and notice that you're constantly struggling to make it through the day without needing a nap, consider hitting the gym as soon as possible.

**Poor Sleep:** If you're finding that it takes longer and longer to fall asleep at night or that you aren't sleeping as deeply as usual, this could be a sign that your body isn't getting enough physical activity. When your heart rate isn't high enough, it's harder for your body to wind down and relax, which can lead to insomnia or poor sleep quality if left unchecked.

## #3 It's been an entire week since your last workout, and your body aches in ways it didn't before

If you're a regular at the gym, you know that your body starts to remind you that it's time to get back in the game after a week or two of not working out. But what about those of us who have been on a long-term hiatus? Do we still have to feel guilty about not working out for weeks or months?

The answer is yes. The reasons why are pretty straightforward. We all need to exercise for good health and well-being, but we also need to do it regularly for optimal benefit. If you haven't set foot in the gym in six months, it will take at least three months of regular exercise before you start to see improvements again. That's because your fitness level will be so low from lack of activity that it will take that long to get back into shape.

## #4 Your friends are noticing the changes in your attitude and energy, particularly those that are more physically active than you

This can be a good thing. We all know that going to the gym is not just about losing weight or buffing up those muscles. Some go for the mental health benefits that exercise and working out offer. Others go for their overall health, or simply to socialize.

However, the gym can be challenging for some people, and if you are not motivated to go there on your own, you should try to set up a plan to meet someone at the gym.

Trying to lose weight on your own can be very difficult. You need to make sure that you have enough time to do all the exercises and eat healthy meals. If you do not have enough time, it is better for you to go with a friend who can help motivate you throughout the week.

Going with a friend will help both of you stay motivated throughout the week. If you are having a bad day and do not want to work out, your friend will urge you to go. Also, if one of you is having a good day and wants to push themselves further, they will help your friend stay motivated by pushing them as well.

Going with a friend will help keep each of you accountable for what you have said that day. If one of your friends wants to make sure that they are losing weight during the week, they will be able to check in with their other friends at the gym or on their phones after every workout.

These are only a few reasons why you should go back to the gym, but there are countless more. The fact that you are reading this article is already a sign that you might need to go back.

Everyone has their own motivations, so it's up to you to make sure that yours is the right one. Work on yourself and make sure that you're clear about what you really want. Remember, no one can achieve anything if they don't set the right goals for themselves. Trust me, when you look good, you feel good. Now, go hit the gym!
