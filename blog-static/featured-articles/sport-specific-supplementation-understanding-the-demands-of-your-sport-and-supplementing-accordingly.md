# Energy Systems and Sports Supplementation

Energy Systems are chemical pathways that our body uses to resynthesis Adenosine Tri Phosphate for daily activities and structured exercise. These energy systems include the ATP-PC energy system, lactic energy system, and the aerobic energy system. Well-trained energy systems provide ATP at a faster rate and can extend the duration of high-intensity activity.

Depending on the dominant energy system involvement in specific sports will also have an influence on optimal supplementation requirements to meet the demands of that sport or activity. **Creatine Phosphate or Phosphocreatine** is the most important fuel source in short duration activities where oxygen isn’t required for the production of energy, a great example of this would be sprinting, weightlifting, shot put, or other field events that require a burst of force or energy in a short space of time.

Carbohydrates have the ability to be broken down both aerobically and anaerobically depending on the intensity of the activity. Our muscles are the primary storage site for glucose in the form of glycogen, when this is broken down, glucose is released into the bloodstream to provide our bodies with readily available energy. For endurance athletes having readily available carbohydrates ensures the athlete has enough energy and is able to sustain higher intensities for longer periods throughout an event.

**VPA® Performance Gel** is an excellent option due to its combination of carbs and electrolytes for hydration in a small great tasting and easy to consume sachet. Awesome for those long rides or runs where you can’t consume whole foods due to stomach upset or digestion related issues. (Performance Gels are OOS/ phased out)

For those engaged in sports such as weightlifting, powerlifting, or sprinting, you're well aware of the need for short bursts of speed and power. These activities primarily leverage the body's anaerobic energy system, which, while being the fastest for ATP resynthesis, also has the lowest ATP production rate. With this in mind, it's essential to consider a pre-workout supplement that's precisely designed to cater to these high-intensity energy demands and ensure your body is primed for the task ahead.

**VENOM® PRE-WORKOUT** is an outstanding pre-workout option for those looking to maximize their power output or strength. This pre-workout supplement, which is loaded with ingredients like Ashwagandha Extract for strength enhancement, Taurine for antioxidant benefits, and Siberian Ginseng for focus and endurance support, not only helps boost energy levels but also enhances your body's ability to produce ATP. That means you're able to sustain high-intensity, anaerobic work for longer periods of time. And with added benefits from increased Caffeine, Citrulline Malate, Creatine, L-tyrosine, and AAKG, VENOM® promises to support your performance goals effectively.

Athletes who perform strength or power-based activities like weightlifting, powerlifting, or sprinting rely on short bursts of speed and power to move heavy weights from A to B. In these kinds of activities, the anaerobic energy system is the dominant driving force for energy production. This is considered the strongest of the 3 systems due to the rate at which ATP is able to be resynthesized, however, it has the lowest rate of ATP production.

**VPA® Creatine Monohydrate** is the ideal evidence-based supplement for strength or power athletes looking to maximize their power output or strength, creatine supplementation helps to replenish creatine phosphate stores and resynthesize ATP so that anaerobic work can be sustained for longer periods of time.

Lastly, the ‘lactic acid energy system’ or ‘anaerobic glycolysis’ supplies ATP at a slightly slower rate than the ATP-PC energy system previously mentioned. The rate of which is limited by the accumulation of Hydrogen ions in the blood. **VPA® Beta Alanine** is a product that helps to reduce fatigue by neutralizing the lactic acid that accumulates in our bodies with exercise. Supplementing beta alanine increases the body's natural levels of Carnosine, which is important and ultimately allows us to exercise at our best for longer and helps increase the number of reps we are able to perform closer to maximal effort.
