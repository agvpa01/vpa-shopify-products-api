The cold winter months can be challenging. It is important to ensure that you stay active during these months to avoid the winter blues. So how do we do it? Here are some tips on how you can make sure to keep active during the cold winter months.

## Get out the door

It may seem like a simple suggestion, but getting up and out of bed can be tough when facing dark mornings and cold weather. If you know you want to exercise, set yourself an alarm 30 minutes before your usual wake-up time so don't oversleep. This will ensure that you get up when it's still dark outside but also give yourself enough time to prepare for your workout routine without rushing around frantically in a mad panic.

## Get active with your pet

Go for walks with your pet. Walking is a great way to get exercise, but if it's too cold outside for outdoor walking, take your dog or cat for a walk on a treadmill inside instead! Or, if you don't have a pet, borrow one from a friend or neighbour so you can go walking together!

## Try a new workout class

Many different fitness classes are available at gyms throughout the city and online. This includes indoor cycling, HIIT training, yoga, Bootcamp, and spin classes. These classes are great because they keep your heart rate up but don't require extra equipment beyond an indoor bike or treadmill.

Roll out your mat. If you don't have access to a class, try doing yoga at home using YouTube videos or DVDs (do they still exist, though?). Yoga is great for increasing flexibility and strength, plus it's meditative too! You can also do some stretching exercises right in your living room after work if you get home early enough.

## Find a gym buddy and make it a weekly date to workout together

Find a gym buddy and make it a weekly date to workout together. Instead of hitting the gym alone and feeling lonely, why not join forces with someone else who has similar goals? This way, you'll have someone there to motivate you if you feel unmotivated after a long day at work. Try not to skip any of these dates, as this will help you stay motivated during the cold months ahead.

Having a workout partner makes it easier to stick to your exercise routine because they will keep you accountable. Make sure you choose someone who has similar goals as you do so that you can encourage each other and push each other to reach them!

Most gyms offer free trial memberships, which means there's no risk involved if you decide not to join after your challenge ends. You can try out different classes before deciding which ones work best for you.

## Sign Up For A Fall/ Autumn gym Challenge

Fall is a great time to get into shape. It's not too hot, and you don't have to worry about getting a sunburn. You can stay active through the winter months by signing up for a fall/ autumn challenge.

## Get off the couch and dance!

Dancing is an excellent way to burn calories and have fun at the same time! You can dance solo or with a group of friends at home or in a community centre near you. If you don't know how to dance, try looking up some easy beginner steps online so that you can master them before hitting the floor!

## Get some fresh (but cold) air

Going for a walk, run, or bike ride will help keep you warm and can help you stay fit. You'll also be getting those endorphins and fresh air that you need to beat the winter blues.

You don't need to stay indoors for winter. Instead, take a walk outside. This can help boost your mood and relieve stress. And since fresh air has anti-inflammatory properties, it can improve lung function and reduce asthma symptoms when taken regularly.

Don't let the cold keep you cooped up inside this winter. Use these tips to stay active and motivated. There are plenty of ways to keep your body and mind healthy in spite of the weather including being consistent with your [protein supplement intake](https://www.vpa.com.au/collections/best-sellers).

Together with a balanced diet and daily supplements, make one of these activities your new daily (or weekly) routine, and you'll wonder why you ever thought the winter season was all that bad in the first place.
