## The Impact of Stress on Leaders

Stress management is a critical skill for leaders who are often at the forefront of decision-making, conflict resolution, and strategic planning. In [Gallup’s recent 2023 Global Workplace report](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/349484/state-of-the-global-workplace.aspx), it revealed a worrying trend: East Asia and the U.S./Canada region share the top spot for workplace stress, with over half (52%) of employees feeling overwhelmed. While Australia and New Zealand follow closely behind at 47%. As a leader, the weight of responsibility for your team's well-being can exacerbate your own stress. But take heart. A shift in perspective is key to managing stress and improving our overall well-being. The [World Health Organization's](https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/stress) definition of stress offers a glimmer of hope:

"Stress can be defined as a state of worry or mental tension caused by a difficult situation. Stress is a natural human response that prompts us to address challenges and threats in our lives. Everyone experiences stress to some degree. **The way we respond to stress, however, makes a big difference in our overall well-being.”**

This article explores research-based strategies and proactive steps to help leaders navigate through their roles with confidence and manage stress to emerge stronger.

## From Fight-or-Flight to Focus and Flow

The good news is your body is wired to help you manage stress and it is one of the most effective ways to manage stress – through physical movement and exercise. When faced with a perceived threat, your body releases [cortisol](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/training/fitness-hormones), a hormone that triggers the fight-or-flight response. And when you exercise, your body releases endorphins, natural mood elevators that combat stress and leave you feeling energised. Furthermore, exercise increases the production of neurotrophic factors, which support the growth and repair of brain cells, thereby enhancing cognitive function and emotional regulation.

Research from Edith Cowan University in Australia found that at least 20 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise three times a week can significantly reduce stress hormone levels and improve mood.

**Find your movement mojo:** Whether it's a morning jog, a lunchtime yoga session, or a post-work swim, incorporate physical activity into your routine. Schedule it into your calendar like any other important meeting – your mind and body will thank you. Not only will you feel more energised and focused, but you'll also be setting a positive example for your team.

## Pick Your Battles: Not Every Hill Needs Conquering

Leadership often involves making tough decisions and managing conflicts. However, not every issue requires immediate attention or confrontation. In the same light, with an increase in hybrid and remote working trends, leaders often find themselves falling into the trap of micromanagement – the ultimate energy drain for you and your team. This approach is not only unsustainable, but it also breeds resentment and disengagement within your team.

A [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12510608/) on the effects of micromanagement emphasises the importance of [delegating effectively](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11499078/).

Discern which tasks require your immediate intervention and delegate the rest to your team members and empower them to take ownership. Think about it – a team that feels empowered to make decisions is a team that's more engaged and ultimately, more successful.

**Focus on the Forest, Not Just the Trees:** The relentless pursuit of perfection can be a major stressor. Remember, in the grand scheme of things, minor details often ...
