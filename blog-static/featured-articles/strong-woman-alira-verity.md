1. **What’s the best thing about being a StrongWoman athlete? What do you enjoy most about it?**

I love the training really hard and heavy while having movements that are technically difficult too. Gives me heaps to work on.

2. **How do you condition your body and mind when training for competitions? How does a typical training for a strong woman athlete look like?**

I make sure my coach and I have a plan, I also up my recovery and food leading into a competition. I normally do a strength/technique piece then all accessories and a possible workout to do.

3. **What’s the recommended diet or fuel when preparing for StrongWoman competitions?**

It is different for every single person so I would advise seeking out someone who can help you. However, I will say keep your protein high and don’t skip the carbs.

4. **Can you give us one advice for anyone wanting to work their way up and join strong woman competitions?**

Just join a group of people you feel comfortable with and who support you, give it a go and have some fun with it.

5. **What's your favorite VPA® supplement? What are the products you recommend, especially for those who are in strength sports?**

Hands down the rainbow and mocha flavored protein powder. I also love the beet powder, a great natural way to get a pre-workout in!
