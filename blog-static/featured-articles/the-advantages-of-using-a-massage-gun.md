A massage gun is a medical device used to knead and massage the muscles in a person's body. The gun is operated by squeezing a trigger which causes the rubber tube to shoot out probes onto the person's skin.

Massage guns are known to be a great way of releasing tension in the body and [increased ROM](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7675623/). These devices have since innovated as most of them already provide different intensity levels. They can provide a light massage to deep muscle therapy. Here are a few more benefits for using a massage gun:

## Helps Remove Lactic Acid

While regular massages are excellent for athletes who need to relieve their muscles after a long workout, it can be challenging to find the time and energy with our busy schedules. Not only that, but most of us don't have anyone available to come over and give us a massage on demand. Thankfully, massage guns are now widely available. This device can help you save your body from lactic acid without having to spend hours getting a professional treatment!

Massage guns work by using a combination of air pressure and vibration to break up lactic acid and scar tissue in the muscle. This process helps with pain relief, improving circulation, and increasing range of motion. It is important to note that while these devices cannot penetrate as deep into muscles as hands can, they can help smooth out knots quickly.

## Promotes Faster Healing for Muscle Injury

People also use a massage gun for the treatment of muscle injuries. The massage gun stimulates the muscle by vibrating it with a low frequency. This type of therapy is an alternative to manual therapy. It helps treat patients who cannot undergo physical therapy, such as the elderly and those recovering from a stroke.

When used on muscle injuries, the accumulated tension and fluid in the injured area is released. This then promotes better circulation and thus helps promote faster recovery for the injury.

## Promotes Faster Pain Relief

You might not realize it, but when you're in pain, your circulation can get worse. That's because the body is trying to protect itself by sending more blood to the muscles and less to the areas of injury. The reduction in blood flow causes the pressure in your veins to increase, which hurts and restricts movement even more. One way that you can reduce pain is by increasing circulation. This will reduce inflammation, improve joint mobility and reduce pressure on swollen tissues.

Many people use massage guns on their feet, back, and neck. The vibrations and pressure from the massage gun can be taken through the skin and muscles, which stimulate circulation in the body. This is important because better circulation helps decrease pain.

## Reduces Muscle Spasm

Massage guns are also used for therapeutic purposes to reduce muscle spasms. The vibrations of the massage gun cause the muscles to contract mildly, which helps stimulate blood circulation in the area of the massage.

The vibrations also release tension in soft tissues by creating a vibration therapy effect that can help loosen tight muscles. The use of a massage gun improves circulation and reduces muscle spasms. They are often used on sore or tense areas of the body, such as sports injuries, chronic conditions, and areas where muscles have been overused.

## Relieves Muscle Stiffness

Muscle stiffness is a condition that can occur after an injury, prolonged overuse of the muscles, or even just during the cold season. When they become stiff, they hinder our mobility and make it difficult to do day to day tasks.

Massage guns are a good solution when you have muscle stiffness that cannot be relieved by just doing [stretching exercises](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/the-benefit-of-regular-stretching-mobility). The massage gun gently loosens tight and sore muscles. Some people even use these guns as part of their exercise routine because of the health benefits it provides.

When it comes to pregnant women and massage guns, there was no significant research that suggests if it is contraindicated or not. Some [articles](https://exogun.com/blogs/news/are-percussion-massages-safe-during-pregnancy) have stated that pregnant women can use massage guns, but only on certain parts of their bodies. For precautionary purposes, it is better to consult your physician before using the said gadget.

Massage guns are a relatively new concept that has been introduced to the market in the last three years. There are numerous benefits to using massage guns, including how quickly they can get someone into a relaxed state. Additionally, these devices' low-pressure stimulation provides therapeutic benefits for issues like headaches, PTSD, and tight muscles.

The idea of having a massage gun might seem strange at first for some people, but they are really easy to use. The majority of people who have used one have found it to be very relaxing and calming. They also report that it is often much more affordable and convenient than regularly visiting an actual masseuse or spa service.

Since these massagers have different intensity levels, you can choose one that fits best for your current condition. You may want to use it to relax your muscles, or even when you want a thorough muscle therapy. You can use them as you please. With this, you might want to consider getting yourself a massage gun!
