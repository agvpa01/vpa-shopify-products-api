## Every second of the day, we make conscious decisions about how to move our bodies. We can either sit at a desk and work or go for a run, and it all impacts how we feel.

Tracking our movement with a fitness tracker allows us to understand this connection between the quality of our lives and the quality of our decisions. Although it is not necessarily needed, it is a great tool to have to keep one motivated and to make better choices about what we do throughout the day, what we eat, and how much sleep we get.

Fitness trackers have become increasingly popular over recent years because they allow people to be more aware of their actions and what they want from their lifestyle. This awareness has led many people to lead healthier lives with more energy to live better every day. There is more than one advantage of getting a helpful gadget such as a tracker.

The price point of fitness trackers varies depending on the features offered and the brand that is selling them. Usually, the more advanced the features are, the higher in price point it will be. Some fitness trackers offer a wide range of features like controlling music from your device or having sleep tracking, while others might only provide a specific feature like counting steps taken.

## Can Track Your sleep

As mentioned above, many fitness trackers are able to monitor sleep quality and patterns when worn while asleep. Some people may not be aware of how important sleep is as it impacts a person's health and performance in sports and fitness activities.

Enough rest should never be taken for granted. Lack of quality sleep causes health problems because [studies](https://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/need-sleep/whats-in-it-for-you/health#:~:text=Numerous%20studies%20have%20found%20that,associated%20with%20a%20shortened%20lifespan.) have shown that poor sleep can increase the risk for various mental and physical health conditions.

There is a lot of evidence that shows the importance of enough sleep. Studies show that it is linked to obesity, diabetes, depression, and a higher risk for stroke. Sleep deprivation also impacts your attention span and memory, making it hard to do your work or schoolwork.

For example, one study found that people who slept less than six hours a night were more likely to be obese than those who slept more than seven hours each night. Another study found that employees who slept less than six hours per night were at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes compared with those who slept seven hours a night or more.

The data collected from fitness trackers will give you more insight into how you spend your time sleeping and how well you are getting quality sleep.
