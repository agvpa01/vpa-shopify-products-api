### What is BCAA's role in muscle growth and recovery?

BCAA or [Branched-chain amino acids](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/bcaa-2-1-1) are the three essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized by the human body and must be consumed through diet. There is a lot of food where BCAAs can be found. Foods such as chicken, beef, eggs and some vegetables like spinach or broccoli are its main sources. Though you can get it from these products, it may not be enough, primarily if you work out.

You need enough BCAA in your body to fully get its benefits. [The reason](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5568273/) is this: there are nine BCAAs altogether, but the three that are considered to be the most important for muscle growth and recovery are leucine, isoleucine, and valine. BCAA provides these three.

These amino acids contain nitric oxide, which helps regulate blood pressure by widening blood vessels to prevent high blood pressure. They also provide energy to muscles and help with muscle protein synthesis. These amino acids also regulate the metabolism of glucose in the body. They may reduce muscle breakdown and improve exercise performance. Imagine all those benefits in one source!
