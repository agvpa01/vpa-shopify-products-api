Many of us spend hours seated every day, whether that be while commuting, or sitting down at work or through exposure to excessive screen time. If this resonates with you, there is a large likelihood that you suffer from a tight neck, sore shoulders, or persistent low back pain.

Not so Fun Fact:
Almost 2 in every 5 (38%) Australians reported experiencing 'moderate intensity' symptoms of back pain between 2017-18. It is estimated that 70-90% of Australians will suffer from lower back pain at some point in their lives!
According to the Australia institute of Health and Welfare, back problems relate to a range of conditions that impact the bones, joints connective tissue, nerves, and muscles. These conditions impact the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine, along with the sacrum and coccyx. The causes of back pain are vast, with most commonly reported cases relating to injury or poor posture. Furthermore, chronic conditions like osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, disc damage and some genetic conditions can all cause non-specific chronic lower back pain. Factors which increase the risk of increasing lower back pain symptoms include:
- increasing age
- reduced levels of physical fitness
- smoking
- being overweight
- And often most commonly occupation

When it comes to treating lower back pain, there are some important principles to follow:
1. Firstly, exercise should be undertaken only with a tolerable or manageable level of pain. Pushing through your symptoms will certainly cause a flare up and reduce your pain threshold in the process.
2. Secondly, bed rest and no physical activity is also not ideal. When it comes to pain management, inactivity lead to the degeneration of the muscles and joints, which can result in the ramping up the pain response. The answer in this situation is the Goldilocks principle - not too much, nor too little. Work up to your pain symptoms, but do not push through them. Pain shouldn't get worse with exercise. If it does, try a different exercise that doesn't provoke pain symptoms initially.

Aim to maintain a quota of exercise you can handle. When you experience a flare up, look to reduce intensity rather than the amount of exercise you do. To get you started, try the simple resistance exercises below that you can do in the comfort of your home. The exercises target the abdominal region while keeping your spone in a neutral position.
