### School Holidays and Staying Fit While Traveling

School holidays have seemed to come rolling in quicker than ever- it only feels like yesterday we were trying to keep those darling children entertained at home in the last school holidays (edit: if you are from Victoria of NSW, you *were* most likely keeping them home very *recently* with the snap lockdown!). But if you are anything like me, the thought of staying around home for an entire 14 days does not sound ideal- you will have already organised your next trip away from home. I know you probably feel like you have only just started to get back into the fitness movement- it’s only been two weeks since the GYMS have officially been able to open up again, so you don’t want to lose your momentum. Here are some great ideas to stay fit while traveling:

The Australian Government had some guidelines that I believe are more important now than ever before, that is to think of movement as an opportunity, not an inconvenience. This is where any form of movement is seen as an opportunity for improving health, not as a time-wasting inconvenience. The advances in technology these days have meant that a lot of the activities that humans once did that involved movement have been reduced significantly. But, years and years of human evolution have shown us that we, the hunter and gatherers, need to move our bodies for optimal health. Instead of opting for a cruisy holiday down by the beach, why not take the tents and bikes out and camp down the river. Not only will you have ample more opportunities to move your body but you will be in abundance of fresh air, Vitamin D and be engulfed in our beautiful scenery.

### Simple Ways to Stay Active While Traveling

- Instead of taking the lift, opt for the staircase if you are staying in a hotel and get that heart beat up!
- Choose to park the car a few blocks away so that you need to walk more than a few meters.
- Try some body-weight exercises such as planks, sit-ups, mountain-climbers, jump-squats, forward and backward lunges, push-ups. Aim for 60 seconds of work with 30 seconds of rest in between.
- Aim for a sunrise or sunset walk and witness Mother Nature’s beauty.
- Make use of the time you spend lining up in queues - add in some sumo squats or lunges to help pass the time.
- Pack a super light resistance band into your suitcase- these cheap and easily transportable pieces of equipment allow you to do pulling movements that are sometimes hard to do without weights or a pull-up bar. If you haven’t got one- just try to make do with any of the equipment that you have with you. For example: door frames for chin-ups!

### Eating Well While Traveling

Staying fit while traveling also involves ensuring that you are eating well, you don’t always need to be eating high-sugar and salt pre-packaged foods. Being prepared with your snacks is the best way to avoid making those irrational decisions fueled by hunger. Try some of these easy snacks:

- Sliced vegetables such as capsicum, cucumber, tomatoes, and celery are a great combination with a tzatziki or hummus dip. Not only are they cost-effective and tasty, but they are full of fiber and essential vitamins and minerals.

### COVID Safety Tips

It’s also important that during this trying time, we ensure that we are practicing Covid Safety. These include:

- Keeping a safe distance from other travelers (1.5 meters)
- Try limiting your contact with frequently touched surfaces, such as handrails, shared cooking facilities, or recreational areas and if you can’t avoid contact; making sure you sanitize regularly.
- Keep a pack of face masks, hand sanitizer, and disinfectant wipes in an easy to reach place at all times so that you are prepared.
- Clean your hands often- especially after fueling your car!

Enjoy your travels!
