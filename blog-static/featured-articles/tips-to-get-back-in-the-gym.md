### Have you been thinking about going back to the gym but struggling with motivation?

This is the sign for you to go back! Exercise is crucial for your physical and mental health and for your well-being on a day-to-day basis. Let's get started with some tips on how to get back to the gym and back in shape!

## Set Realistic Goals

There is a common pattern in the gym that you all know and love: people start too hard and quit. This is because they set goals that are too ambitious to achieve, and it only takes one bad day for them to give up.

When you go back to the gym after a long break, it's essential to set realistic goals before you begin your workout.

Goals that are too easy can be discouraging and leave you feeling like you didn't accomplish anything. On the other hand, too difficult goals can cause frustration and cause people to give up before they've even started.

It's important that you set achievable goals right away so that when your motivation starts to wane, it doesn't become discouraging. Goals also need to be measurable and time-sensitive. No point in having a big goal and overwhelming yourself. Concrete success comes from setting small achievable goals.

## Practice Patience

Remember that fitness is a lifestyle so patience is key. People often find it difficult to stay committed to long-term physical improvements. They might not have the resources or support that other people have, or they might be lacking in willpower.

So what can you do when your motivation starts to plateau? Allow yourself to take short breaks and find small successes along the way.

Patience is an important factor in any successful exercise routine. Take it easy and remember that small achievements lead to the bigger picture. Also, know that some days wonâ€™t be as great as the others - you can get bad days. Set rest days or consider mixing up your workout splits or routines.

## Build a Support Group

When starting a new exercise routine, it's important to build a support group. This is because it can be hard to keep pushing yourself when you have no one else to share your struggles with.

They keep you accountable, push you to go harder, pick you up when you need it, and celebrate your wins. It's important to have people that motivate you and push you to work out.

If you have no idea how it works, you can start with this:

- Designate one day each week when everyone will meet and share their progress and wins with. You can also share lessons from setbacks and any tips about your workout.
- Invite friends and family members to work out with you. Working out together or training at the same sessions as your support group allows you to motivate each other.

Surround yourself with people who motivate you and want to see you win.

## Treat Yourself

Treating yourself is essential to maintain your motivation for exercising after a break. As simple as buying a new gym outfit can make a lot of difference. It makes you feel good and helps build confidence - trainers will notice, your support group will notice, and they will make comments. You can look good while feeling good!

If you treat yourself, you get more motivated. A [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3441783/) has proven that the more motivated you are, the more likely you'll stick to your workout and fitness goals.

## Just start

If you want to go back to the gym, you need to start now. It's important not to wait for a mood or motivation before starting because once those feelings come, it might be too late.

Mood and motivation are not what will help you succeed at going back to the gym. Look at yourself in the mirror and visualize the body you want to achieve. Whether you want to lose weight or bulk up, envisioning what you want to achieve can be motivating. Your return to the gym does not have to be perfect. You don't need a concrete and detailed plan just yet. All you got to do is start and start now.

---

## Have Fun

The most important part when going back to the gym is to have fun. Working out does not have to be tedious and feel like a chore. Make new friends at the gym, or create a playlist of your favorite gym songs to help you get in the zone.

You can even learn a new skill like CrossFit or yoga and take your fitness goals up a notch! Enjoy your time at the gym, and you'll be motivated to come back.

### Bonus:

When your goals slowly come to fruition, and you start seeing results, it motivates you to work out more.
