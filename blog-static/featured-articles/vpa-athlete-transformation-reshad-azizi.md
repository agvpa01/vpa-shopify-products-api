## What was life before you started on your fitness journey? And what made you start going down this path?

"Before I started my fitness journey, I was an active and competitive high school student who applied himself at the eleventh hour during my senior years. This vigour naturally stemmed from playing sport (specifically tennis in Round Robin tournaments) as well as club level cricket. However I wasn't always like this, as my junior years were marred with bullying experiences (both physical and verbal) since I had moved high schools. Being the "new kid on the block" wasn't helpful, as I lost the childhood friends made from my formative primary schooling years. I did not know how to fight back against the bullying, and my parents never understood the repercussions of it either. In the end I had to "shield" myself from these bullies with no help - despite not knowing how to do so - and continued to carry on.

After being accepted into my first preference of courses at one of Australia's top universities, I envisioned that there would be light at the end of the tunnel, that this was the start of a splendid journey. However good habits would eventually turn to bad habits, due to the brutal combination of complacency and lack of purpose. Instead of continuing the competitive sporting streak, I started a new competitive streak in online gaming; I would spend up to 15 hours per day playing Counter Strike 1.6 (That's 105 hours per week), and coupled this with poor eating choices and lack of sleep. And if this wasn't enough tribulation, I was also enduring personal family problems that were beginning to take a toll on me. I became a social recluse, neglecting both my high school and university friends. The lack of purpose became more and more detrimental - I did not know what I wanted to accomplish with this degree, and nothing in high school prepared me well enough for the various challenges of tertiary education - this led to the failure of several subjects. In short, my head was in a dark place.

Although I had sought help from two different psychologists and the university counselling services, no one was able to successfully address my declining mental health. Yet despite all of this, I started developing a sense of self-awareness. It was upon further reflection that I realized I desperately needed to look after my mental and physical health. I needed to unlearn my bad habits and create good habits, otherwise things would get uglier. This is where my journey had begun in the gym.

## What is your training style and how often do you train? Can you share your average week with us?

In terms of training, I was previously following a push-pull split as stipulated by my online coach. Since competitions have been canceled by the COVID-19 pandemic, I have transitioned back to a 6-day bodybuilding “bro split” by focusing on each muscle group, with an allocated rest day. If I am cutting, I also do 20 minutes of fasted cardio every morning, and 40 minutes of cardio after my gym session. For example, a typical split would be:

- Monday: Chest
- Tuesday: Shoulders
- Wednesday: Back
- Thursday: Arms
- Friday: Legs
- Saturday: Shoulders
- Sunday: Rest

Note that at one point, I would train legs twice a week for 3 years straight, along with chest twice a week for 3 years straight. However, my current key focus area is shoulders since I have deemed them a lagging body part.

## What specific role did diet play in the process? Is there a diet you recommend to build muscle?

Diet has definitely played a significant role in this process. Funnily enough, when I started this fitness journey I was advised from a friend of mine - who had a good physique - that KFC was an adequate source of protein. So I took on his advice and ate copious amounts of junk food while going to the gym. Eat big to get big right? Unfortunately, that did not turn out well and instead of swole Reshad, I became skinny fat Reshad Azizi.

In terms of major changes to my diet, I learned how to cook healthy foods through YouTube tutorials and educated myself on the basic principles of calories and macronutrients. To build muscle, you simply have to work out your caloric maintenance (based on your age, weight, height, and activity levels) and then proceed to consume calories at a surplus (in other words above your maintenance level). The opposite applies when it comes to leaning down and being in a caloric deficit. I strongly believe that there is no “one size fits all approach” when it comes to a diet (for example the cookie diet, ketogenic diet, vegan diet, and so forth) as I feel that the majority of these "fad" diets are unsustainable in the long run due to their overly restrictive nature. At the end of the day, it all comes down to figuring out which healthy foods best suit your lifestyle, and then being in a caloric surplus to build muscle.

## What’s your favorite VPA® supplements? Which ones do you recommend?

In terms of my favorite VPA® supplements, I would choose the [Whey Protein Isolate](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder) Rainbow Ice cream flavor (it tastes like Streets Paddlepop Ice Cream!), [BCAA 7000](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/bcaa-7000) peached ice tea flavor (just like the refreshing Lipton Ice Tea, without the unnecessary calories!), iced coffee [Breakfast shake](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/breakfast-shake) (perfect for a quick smoothie) and [casein whey protein](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/micellar-casein) before bedtime. Note that I have also been using the [Summer FOMO™](/products/summer-fomo) lately on a regular basis, and this is helping with both appetite suppression and energy provision for my morning fasted cardio sessions. Altogether, these are the supplements that I am currently using at the moment and I highly recommend them too.
