#### Chia Health

If you’re looking for a refreshingly healthy and nutritious drink you can add to your diet; this is it. We recommend starting your day with Chia Health. Despite their size, chia seeds are packed with essential nutrients, such as omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and fibre that are good for heart health and in improving digestion.

With less than two teaspoons of added sugar per bottle and chia seeds, you’ll probably drink more of this than plain water — one more way to help stay hydrated.

Available flavours: Apple & Grape
