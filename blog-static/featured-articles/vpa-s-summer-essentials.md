### It's a new year and the heat is on. To help you maximise your gains this summer, we've put together a guide of VPA® Summer Essentials; the must-have products you'll be needing this season.

#### PROTEIN WATER
Our first summer essential is VPA® ready-to-drink Protein Water. With 30g of protein per serve, these refreshing drinks contain WPI which is quickly absorbed by the body to promote muscle tissue growth and recovery. Not to mention, they come in two mouth-watering flavours and have less than 1g of fat and carbohydrates.
If you prefer to mix up your own protein water to suit your taste, try our powdered protein water which contains WPI, collagen, BCAAs and electrolytes. Not only does it support rapid muscle recovery, but it also ensures maximum hydration for peak performance.

#### SUMMER FOMO
Summer FOMOTM is VPA®'s new and improved fat burner which contains a range of ingredients to increase metabolism, boost energy levels and suppress hunger.
The green tea extract and caffeine have a thermogenic effect, meaning that they promote fat burning to help you achieve that summer bod. Caffeine also increases reaction time and boosts energy levels to help you get the most from your workout. You'll also find L-carnitine which helps the body to burn fat more efficiently.
Summer FOMOTM also contains acacia fibre which absorbs water making you feel fuller for longer. In this way, it can assist in suppressing hunger and aid weight loss. Of course, VPA® recommends taking Summer FOMO in conjunction with a healthy diet and training program.

#### VPA® CREW SOCKS
When hitting the gym this summer, do it in style with VPA®'s Crew Socks. With a cushioned toe and heel for ultimate comfort, a high crew sock fit, and jacquard VPA® logos on both sides, you'll be turning heads in these babies.

#### PROTEIN PANCAKE MIX
If you're after a quick and easy breakfast this summer you can't go past VPA® Protein Pancake Mix. These pancakes are packed with over 26g of protein per serve, MCT for energy and psyllium husk for healthy digestion. Available in two delicious flavours, whether you top them with fresh fruit, yogurt, or syrup, you are sure to love these!

#### CREATINE MONOHYDRATE
Finally, if you're looking to build lean muscle this bikini season, try VPA® Creatine Monohydrate. Creatine is used by muscle cells to rapidly produce energy during high-intensity and resistance exercise. For this reason, it's popular among athletes to improve performance, increase strength and power output, and to build muscle mass.
