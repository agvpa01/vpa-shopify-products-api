Weight Cutting in Powerlifting

---

Weight cutting (also known as a water cut) is an area of powerlifting that I see not being done well on a frequent basis. Honestly, I see it as a bit of a gap in the sport where people are missing out on a massive potential advantage.

In a lot of combat sports where making weight is a requirement as well, it is at the point where almost everybody undertakes a significant weight cut. If an athlete chooses not to do one, it puts them at a noticeable disadvantage due to the difference in size and muscle mass.

Interestingly enough, even though weight cuts can provide an advantage, they haven’t become a part of the culture of powerlifting, which is why I see it as a bit of a gap.

At one end of the spectrum, there are quite a lot of people, even at the elite level who don’t do weight cuts at all. They just aim to weigh near the top end of their weight class in the weeks leading up to the weigh-in. This is leaving a massive competitive edge on the table.

There is an obvious advantage to weighing 5-10% more than your competitors if you are still able to make weight and then rehydrate and replenish yourself in time for the competition so that you have no loss of performance.

The other aspect I see is people attempting a weight cut but implementing it poorly in a way that hinders their performance.

One common mistake is attempting to cut too much weight since even if you do it as effectively as possible, there is only so much you can cut while being able to recover in time to compete without loss of performance.

The other mistake I see is people only using one main mechanism, rather than the full range of tools available.

Even the fact that a lot of people call it a “water cut” instead of a weight cut highlights this. If you are solely manipulating water and ignoring the other variables, you will not be able to get the best possible outcome.

Ideally, you want the loss of weight to come from a combination of dehydration, glycogen depletion and decreased food residue in the gut. If you implement an appropriate strategy to maximise losses from each category in the most efficient manner, you can cut more weight before it affects your performance, compared to if you overly focus on just one of those aspects.

This post is solely going to focus on making weight within the last week of the competition. It won’t cover how to drop body fat or just weight-loss in general since that is a separate topic. These strategies are solely for attempting to create a short-term competitive advantage.

### How Much Can You Cut?

Firstly, I want to start out by saying WHO should do a weight cut.

- If you are **new to powerlifting** or are not looking to place in a high-level competition or break a record, I highly recommend you do not undertake a weight cut. Under those circumstances, I’m of the opinion that your goal should be to make the competition go as smoothly and as enjoyably as possible. Part of that process should be eating up until comp day in a fashion that will best fuel your performance so you feel as strong as possible on the day.
- If you ARE **trying to break a record or place highly** at a comp though, a weight cut might be a necessary part of the process. It is clearly an effective strategy when implemented well and you can lose at least 5% of your body weight within the final week prior to weigh-in without any loss of performance.

One study showed [5% weight-loss over 5 days resulted in no loss in performance](ttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24047570) with only a 4hr weigh-in. Another showed [5% weight loss over just 3 days resulted in similar outcomes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4483414/) with a 12hr weigh-in.

We are lucky that powerlifting often has 24hr weigh-ins, which allows a lot more time for an effective rehydration and replenishment strategy. For the sake of this article, I’m solely focusing on 24hr weigh-ins. These strategies can be utilised for shorter weigh-ins to a certain degree but would need to be scaled down accordingly since there is less time to recover prior to competition.

The maximum weight cut I would recommend for somebody one week out from the competition is ~8% of their body weight. Some people are absolute freaks and can get away with up to 10%, but that isn’t the norm. My recommendation would be to start conservative the first time you try it and then be a little more aggressive if that goes well.

### Hormone Manipulation

Two of the main hormones involved in regulating water balance are aldosterone and anti-diuretic hormone (ADH).

Aldosterone is released in response to decreased sodium. When you drink more water, it lowers the concentration of sodium. In response to this, aldosterone will be released to address low sodium concentration.

While aldosterone indirectly regulates water resorption through regulating sodium, ADH directly regulates water resorption.

When you consume a lot of water, you down-regulate aldosterone and ADH, which causes you to urinate more. But there is a lag effect when you stop consuming that much water before aldosterone and ADH are up-regulated again. This lag effect allows you to drop water more quickly than you otherwise could.

To put this into practical terms for somebody making weight – your intake could look like:

- **Monday** = water intake (in litres) = body weight (in KGs) x 10%
- **Tuesday** = water intake (in litres) = body weight (in KGs) x 10%
- **Wednesday** = water intake (in litres) = body weight (in KGs) x 10%
- **Thursday** = water intake (in litres) = body weight (in KGs) x 10%
- **Friday** = water intake (in litres) = body weight (in KGs) x 1%
- **Saturday (weigh-in day)** = nothing until weigh-in unless comfortably under the desired weight

---

To put it simply, this means if you consistently have a high intake of water, your high output of water will continue for a little while even after you stop taking in that high intake.

There is a similar situation with sodium. If you have a high intake of sodium for most of the week leading up to weigh-in but cut it down within the last 2-3 days prior to weigh-in you can take advantage of that lag effect as well. This will allow you to drop water weight much more effectively than you otherwise would have been able to.

### Glycogen

Glycogen is the storage form of carbohydrate. It is stored in our liver and skeletal muscle. Glycogen itself has weight, but on top of that we typically also hold onto roughly [3g of water weight per gram of glycogen](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25911631). To put context around t...
