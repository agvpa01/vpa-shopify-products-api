## Pre-workout Shots: What You Need to Know

Pre-workout shots are small shots of liquid energy which athletes use before they work out. While many don't have experience with using pre-workout shots, a lot of people may have heard about them and know that athletes take them prior to working out for added intensity.

So should you use them? The short answer is yes. Let us explain further. First, we need to know what it is, its ingredients, and how it can help with any fitness goal.

## What is a Pre-workout Shot?

A pre-workout shot is a nutritional supplement that contains key ingredients to help you enhance your performance, increase focus, and get the most from your workout. It has all the benefits of a large pre-workout drink without the hassle of adding water or excess calories. You simply open and drink! VPA® PWO-200 contains premium ingredients like Beta-Alanine, Taurine, Caffeine, and citrulline malate – the best formula to give you the needed boost in your workout in one small shot.

## Effects of a Pre-workout Shot

The effects of a pre-workout shot depend on what is in them as pre-workout shots are not made equal. VPA’s PWO-200 gives you that jolt of energy you need for your workout, especially with the following ingredients:

- 200mg of caffeine per serve to increase energy levels
- 2g citrulline malate
- 2g of beta-alanine for improved exercise performance
- 2g of AAKG for increased endurance and strength
- + B vitamins to reduce fatigue
- (No fats, carbs, and added sugar)

## Are Pre-workout Shots Safe to Consume?

Taken 20-30 minutes before the start of a workout, pre-workout shots are relatively safe to consume especially for athletes and people with active lifestyles. However, we recommend consulting your doctor before consuming any supplement such as these, especially with its high caffeine content.

We do not recommend any products with high caffeine content for anyone who is pregnant or breastfeeding. Most doctors will advise against taking anything that contains stimulants like caffeine during pregnancy or breastfeeding for safety reasons.

## How are Pre-workout Shots Different from Energy Drinks?

You may have seen pre-workout shots in your local pharmacy and wondered what they're all about. They look similar to energy drinks, so you might wonder whether they are the same thing. The answer is basically no. While energy drinks do contain some of the same ingredients, a few key differences make pre-workout shots unique.

Energy drinks and pre-workout shots contain caffeine, a stimulant that helps increase alertness and energy levels. This can help you get a better workout, but it also comes with a crash later on and some unpleasant side effects like insomnia, headaches, and nervousness.

The difference is that pre-workout shots contain citrulline malate, which has a vasodilation effect. It increases blood flow to muscles, allowing them to contract more efficiently during exercise. Citrulline also reduces/delays the onset of fatigue during training and increases endurance.

## Who Needs a Pre-workout Shot?

If you're constantly exhausted when it's time to hit the gym, or if your energy levels are always at an all-time low for your morning runs, then a pre-workout shot could be the solution to improve your performance. Here are a couple more people that may need a pre-workout shot.

- People looking to boost their energy levels, especially before exercise
- People looking to get more out of their workout
- Athletes that are looking to get an edge on their game

## Side Effects of Taking Pre-workout Shots

If you're interested in taking pre-workout shots, it's good to discuss the pros and cons with your doctor first. Some ingredients in pre-workout shots can have negative side effects if you have certain medical conditions or allergies, so it's important to make sure these supplements are right for you. Also, since there is a lot of variation in the ingredients of pre-workout shots, it's important to know what ingredients are right for you and if they are safe when taken together. If you don't know what the ingredients are, ask your doctor for help interpreting the labels and making sure that the ingredients won't interfere with any medications you take.

The best pre-workout supplements are not only able to increase your physical performance but can also boost your mental focus. This will help you in the long run with being able to be stronger, faster, and, yes, even last longer in the gym. There are other benefits of taking pre-workout shots, like increased energy and endurance. This should help improve your overall results from weightlifting, cardio training, or even running.
