Muscle loss is a common effect of aging. The loss of muscle mass also means that your metabolism will slow down, leading to an accumulation of fat.

Although it’s not easy to reverse the process, there are some things you can do to slow down the rate at which your muscles are being lost. One way of doing this is by increasing your dietary protein intake, the building block for muscle tissue. Protein helps in the protein synthesis process that is responsible for muscle building and repair.

Protein intake is beneficial for muscle growth during resistance exercises as well. In one [study](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1550-2783-11-19), a high-protein diet was shown to improve a body's composition. It was also found that higher levels of lean muscle mass were associated with a decreased risk of age-related diseases such as diabetes and cancer.
