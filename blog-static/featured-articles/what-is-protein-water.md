For athletes and fitness enthusiasts, the importance of protein in one’s diet is apparent and valued. It plays an important role as it helps repair and strengthens the muscles. Hence, the increase in demand for whey protein shakes and workout supplements. But here is something relatively new to some; Protein Water.

You get a source of protein in clear, water form. It is not creamy and milky and comes in different flavors (depending on the kind of brands). It’s like an upgraded energy drink, packed with more nutrients that your body will need to optimize its peak performance. It replenishes your body with protein, amino acids, and electrolytes.

So how did this “Protein Water” make it to the list of our new favorite protein drinks? Is it just a fad? Is it a good protein source to add into our daily protein essentials? Time to dive right into those questions!

### What is protein water?

Protein water is made up of different sources of protein (WPI, collagen, BCAA and L-glutamine) and is combined with water. Ideally, it is high in protein and low in calories. Depending on the brand, some Protein Waters may contain vitamins and minerals such as electrolytes.

### Benefits of protein water

Protein water is a quick and easy way to hydrate and feed your body with muscle-building protein. It is shelf-stable and transportable which makes it a convenient grab and drink protein source. Protein water flows with you, ready to be consumed throughout your day, anytime and anywhere.

### Protein water vs Whey protein powder

Texture. Since protein water is not made purely from dairy, it does not have that milky/creamy texture which some people dislike. You can also find protein powders in different flavors, making it a friendly and refreshing protein source suitable to drink any time.

### Is Protein Water better than Protein Powder?

To conclude, to see which of the two is better will depend on your goals, preferences, and your needs/wants.

If your goal is to build more muscle and boost recovery, then protein powders such as WPI or WPC would still be the perfect choice because they contain the clinical dose of muscle-building protein. Protein powders are also perfect for those who prefer drinking their protein as a shake rather than eating them.

While if you are someone who enjoys protein as a dish and would want to get more sources of high-quality protein in their diet, then protein water is an excellent option for you because it is high in protein and low in calories.

At the end of the day, it all boils down to YOU. Listen to your body. Be it protein water, or protein shake, it will ultimately come down to what you think works best for your body, your health, and what makes you feel better.
