### Whey Isolate (WPI)

Best for pre/post workout

Whey isolate is a pure whey protein isolate powder. Milk has two proteins which are Whey and Casein. When a coagulant (usually renin) is added to milk, the curds (casein) and whey separate. Whey protein is the water-soluble part of milk. Whey is absorbed faster than other forms of protein, which means it also increases muscle protein synthesis used to break a fasted state. WPI is the highest percentage of protein usually 85%+ and very little carbs, fats and lactose being a very lean source of protein. It’s a great protein to take when watching your weight or generally pre or post workout due to its fast absorption rate when compared to other options.

### Premium Whey (WPC)

Best pre/post workout or anytime

Whey Protein Concentrate. Pretty similar to WPI, except it is slightly less processed leaving it with a little bit more fats, carbs and a slightly less percentage of protein per serve. A tiny bit slower absorption rate than WPI but still absorbs into the system within 30 minutes. If you’re after a slightly cheaper option and not concerned about a very small increase in extra fats and carbs then definitely choose this option for almost any time of day to increase your protein intake.
