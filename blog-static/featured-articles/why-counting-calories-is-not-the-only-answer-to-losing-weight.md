### We are often told to count our calories to lose weight. Sounds easy enough, right? Not so fast. Calories may not be the best way for you to figure out what you should eat for your weight loss goals.

Calorie counting is based on the notion that if you take in fewer calories than you burn, then you will lose weight. You focus more on your calorie intake, thinking this is the only way for weight loss. But this is a flawed principle for the main reason that each person's weight fluctuates.

The fluctuation of weight can be frustrating, especially when you have a goal weight in mind. This happens even you feel that you are doing all the healthy things. You take note of your daily calories and even know the number by heart. You may or may not [exercise](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/6-exercise-options-to-stay-active-at-home) because you feel that taking note of how much you consume is enough.

This is untrue. Even when you know your daily calorie intake, there is still the fact that everyone's weight fluctuates. There are a couple of reasons why weight fluctuation occurs:

### Sodium and Carbs Cause Water Retention

Sodium and carbs in your diet are the two culprits that cause water retention and weight fluctuations. Sodium is a component of salt, so it's present to some extent in almost all processed foods. In contrast, carbs are found in grains, fruits, vegetables, and even dairy.

You don't have to cut out these foods entirely from your diet to see less weight fluctuation. You just need to make sure you're not consuming too much salt or carbs at once.

If you are trying to lose weight, it is important to be careful about the number of carbs and sodium you consume. These two substances can cause water retention in your body, which will lead to an increase in weight.

The more water that your body retains, the heavier you might feel. It is also important to note that some people might not retain water due to sodium or carbs in their diet but instead from other sources such as dairy or salt like soy sauce. Take into account as well that you eat foods with high nutrients and proteins, not just look at how many calories it has.

### Hormones

Many different hormones affect your weight. If your body is not producing enough of certain hormones, you may gain more weight than usual. On the other hand, if your body is making too much hormone, you may have trouble losing any weight.

Hormones like estrogen and progesterone can fluctuate during different points in life - like puberty, pregnancy and menopause. When your hormones go out of balance, it can have a big impact on your weight and health. When they are balanced, you will maintain a healthy weight.

Hormones affect our weight in many ways. For example, these chemicals work to control how much food is used for energy and storage when we eat. Hormones also affect the breakdown of fat which helps to keep our bodies slim and healthy.

The most common hormones that cause changes in weight are cortisol and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). These two hormones work together to regulate metabolism so that you don't gain excess pounds too quickly or too slowly.

### Alcohol Consumption

A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7286110/) by the University of California, San Francisco, found that alcohol consumption causes weight fluctuations. The study showed that those who drank alcohol had lower levels of leptin in their bloodstream. After drinking, levels of leptin spiked, which triggered an increase in appetite.

This is because those who drank alcohol ate more than they would have without drinking any alcohol at all. The study also found a difference in how we process food on an empty stomach and when we are full after eating a meal. Alcohol consumed on an empty stomach caused less blood sugar to be released from the liver and allowed more fat to be stored for future use.

### Stress

Stress can cause your weight to fluctuate by influencing your appetite and hormone levels. Stress is a significant factor in our daily lives. Stress also affects how we feel about ourselves and the world around us, which will affect our eating habits, too. For example, someone who feels anxious about an upcoming exam might overeat or skip meals because of emotional distress.

One of the main points is to be aware of your stress level at all times. Assess your eating habits if your emotional state influences them. Do stress management first before feeling guilty that you consumed ten more calories than you expected.

### Dehydration

The weight you see on the scale is not always accurate because it doesn't account for water weight. Water is essential to your body, and if you don't drink enough fluids, your body will start dehydrating. This will lead to a decrease in your bodily fluids, which can result in an increase in weight. This phenomenon is known as "water weight". When you eat low-calorie food, you need to take into account the amount of water in them.

The best way to prevent dehydration is by making sure that you are drinking at least eight glasses of water each day. You can also add more water to your favourite foods like soup and salad. This will make it easier for your body to do what it needs to do- stay hydrated!

### Daily Body Temperature

Your weight can fluctuate based on your daily body temperature is. It is important to keep track of this because it can help predict what the weight gain or weight loss is going to be.

The body's internal thermostat regulates a person's body temperature by keeping it within a narrow range, which affects their weight. A person's metabolism is also regulated by body temperature, so that fluctuations will affect their digestion.

A study found that people who had higher average temperatures had higher ghrelin levels, which increases hunger and appetite levels. This means that those people with fluctuating temperatures are more likely to overeat and feel hungrier than those with steady average temperatures. Knowing these factors should make you more aware of what you eat. There are more ways to lose weight than counting calories per day.

One of the most common mistakes people make when counting calories is overestimating the number of calories they should be eating. People who follow a 1,200 calorie diet might not see a change in their weight because they are already eating close to that number of calories. And when people go on a vegan diet, they are reducing their caloric intake, which can reset their metabolism and cause weight gain.

It does not address the genetic component in determining the body-fat distribution and how people set their natural weights. With that, you already know that weight fluctuates all the time. It would be best if you did not punish yourself by not eating certain foods. Listening to your hunger cues allows you to make healthy choices and not starve yourself.

Still, it is best to get medical advice and consider your current weight and your goal weight. Your physical activity should be taken into account since most people who count calories think they don't need exercise anymore. The best way is still to have a balanced diet and exercise.
