You are ready to get pumped for your next training and you reach out for your favourite tub of pre-workout only to find that it has all clumped up together or has hardened. Has it gone bad? Is it still safe to use? This question of concern is no stranger for our customer service team. In fact, clumpy pre-workout supplements are quite common in the industry and there are a few reasons why this happens. Read further as we answer some of the most asked questions surrounding clumped pre-workouts.

## Why is my pre-workout clumping?

Pre-workouts made with natural ingredients have a greater tendency to clump compared to those made with synthetic ingredients but its safe to say that its effectivity is not compromised. If you have had pre-workouts before that did not clump up easily, it may have had artificial 'anti-caking' agents added to it, which VPA® pre-workouts don't have.

### Made with natural ingredients

Pre-workouts made with natural ingredients have a greater tendency to clump compared to those made with synthetic ingredients but its safe to say that its effectivity is not compromised. If you have had pre-workouts before that did not clump up easily, it may have had artificial 'anti-caking' agents added to it, which VPA® pre-workouts don't have.

### Hygroscopic ingredients

Hygroscopic ingredients are substances that easily attract water molecules at room temperature. If you have been using our pre-workouts, then you would be familiar with some of these hygroscopic ingredients found in VPA® pre-workouts:

- L-Carnitine
- Beta Alanine
- Citrulline Malate
- Creatine Monohydrate
- AAKG

Of course, not all pre-workouts are made with the same ingredients. Each of these pure amino acids which have hygroscopic properties provide a specific function to give you the needed kick to maximize your strength and enhance your performance during your training.

### Storage Environment

Now that we know that your favourite pre-workouts have hygroscopic ingredients that are susceptible to clumping, ensure that you store them properly in a cool, dry place with controlled temperatures. It is worth noting that extreme or excessive heat temperatures will accelerate the clumping process. Make sure the lid is properly closed after opened.

### Not used often

Clumping usually happens to tubs of pre-workout supplements that have not been used for a while. The best tip is to stir or shake and use them often to ensure that they have not settled.

## Is it safe to use clumpy pre-workout?

Yes, it is. Clumping in pre-workouts are natural due to the ingredients that are added to the pre-workout formula. Clumping in pre-workouts does not affect the safety, quality, and effectiveness of the product. When it comes to the safety of sports supplements, there is no cause for worry. The supplements may be a little clumpy in their natural form, but they're perfectly safe when taken as directed. However, once the product has been opened, we advise you to consume within 6 weeks.

## How to prevent or fix clumping pre-workouts

### Keep the silica packets buried in your pre-workout

Every tub of VPA® pre-workout has a silica packet in them. These packets help absorb any moisture from the product. While most people remove these upon opening a fresh tub of pre-workout, keep them inside and buried in your pre-workout to absorb any moisture after being opened.

### Break in your clumped pre-workout with a knife

If it's too late and you're now faced with a clumped up and hardened pre-workout, don’t worry! Break up the chunks of pre-workout with a fork or a knife. Others also opt to chuck them in a blender or food processor. Otherwise, if it doesn't bother you too much, hard or clumped pre-workouts should dissolve easily in water and will give the same desired effect.
