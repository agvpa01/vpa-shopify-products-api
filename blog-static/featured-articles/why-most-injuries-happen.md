When it comes to training, there is nothing worse than getting injured! Injuries are not only a huge setback for your performance, but can also be extremely taxing mentally. For athletes, getting injured is by far their worst case scenario, sometimes it can mean the end of a season or even a playing career. In this article I wanted to address a few strategies that you can implement to help you stay at the top of your game!

As a strength and conditioning coach, I’ve seen it all too many times. Injuries happening as a result of poor judgement and decision making. Don’t get me wrong, most often there are plenty of other factors at play. However, you want to ensure you are doing everything within your control to train at the best of your ability.

Here’s what you can do to make the most of your training, and prevent injuries from happening:

## 1. Perfect Your Technique

Technique is paramount. Understanding your individual biomechanics and how your body moves (especially when under load) is crucial to performing well and preventing injuries from occurring. Whether it’s in the weight room or out on the field, often having a second pair of eyes to give you feedback on how your body is moving is crucial towards developing and improving. You know what they say, practice makes perfect!

## 2. Take the time to Warm Up

Don’t rush your warm up. The goal of any warm up is to prepare the body for motion and prime for the session that is about to be performed. Similar to a race car revving its engine before the starting gun goes off! Making sure your body has adequate blood flow, optimal temperature and joint congruency are all factors that can make the introduction of higher intensity modalities a lot smoother. Take the time to plan your warm ups!

## 3. Recover Properly

One of the most common ways to get injured is from overtraining. This is where your body is put under too much load and essentially burns out. Implementing adequate recovery strategies such as a good night’s sleep, a nutritious diet, supplementation and incorporating active recovery training sessions can be more effective ways to manage this load. Just remember, your body’s ability to perform is only as good as its ability to recover.

## 4. Leave Your Ego at the Door

Believe it or not, this can be one of the biggest reasons why people get injured. They try to perform something that is outside of their capability. Of course, you train to get better and improve. However, being smart about the weights you select or the intensities you train at are ways to prevent any injuries from occurring. Don’t be afraid to run a little slower, or take some weight off the bar. Knowing what you are capable of doing is massively influential towards how you will perform. For years, most Olympic weightlifters will just use the bar without any weight so they can optimize their technique and the way their body moves. Leave your ego at the door and always keep in mind that your only competition is yourself!

Leave your ego at the door and always keep in mind that your only competition is yourself! So there it is! My top 4 tips to make the most of your training and prevent injuries from occurring! Sometimes it’s simply a matter of training smarter not harder. Good luck!
