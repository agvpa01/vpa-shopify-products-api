### We've all been there
We've all been there. You finish a delicious meal, and suddenly all you can think of is sweets. And then the guilt sets in after a few seconds because you just ate a slice of pie or a piece of cake.

You might have wondered why that is. Let us explain:

### What is the Science Behind Sweet Cravings After Eating?
There is no denying that sweets make us feel happy and satisfied. But why do we feel this way after eating? Because we want more of that "happy" feeling.

After eating, our body releases endorphins, which are natural morphine-like substances that act as natural painkillers to suppress feelings of stress, sadness, or anxiety. That's what we want more of.

Understanding your brain's response to sugar is the key to finding out how to stop craving it.
What is it about sugar that makes us crave it? It's not just the taste but also how our brains respond. We usually get a surge of dopamine in response to sugar release, which feels good and makes us want more.

One way to understand this phenomenon is through the "sweet tooth" hypothesis, which suggests that sweet foods cause our bodies to release glucose into our bloodstreams. As a result, we get a surge of happy hormones that make us feel great and want more of them again.

### Imbalance in Blood Glucose Level
It can also be due to an [imbalance in blood glucose level](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/explaining-the-siren-song-of-sugar-and-how-to-beat-the-habit/2018/01/26/8a9557f8-f7ae-11e7-a9e3-ab18ce41436a_story.html#:~:text=Many%20sugar%20cravings%20stem%20from,it%20and%20increase%20your%20energy.). If it's too low even after eating, your body will crave sugar to make your blood glucose level rise.

With that, here are five tips to help you curb the craving for sweets after eating:

### Top 5 Tips to Help You Curb your sweet Cravings
There are many ways to curb your sweet cravings. The most important thing in overcoming the craving is to take control of your emotions and to focus on where you can control what.

1. Accept that it's just not possible to stop craving sweets for good. Instead, get started to reduce the number of times you crave them by 25% each day.
2. Keep track of how often you crave sweets - keep a journal to monitor your food intake and see if it correlates with when you crave sweets more frequently. If so, try making healthier choices that align with when you don't crave them more often - grabbing a fruit instead on a slice of cake, having grilled chicken instead of fried chicken, etc.
3. Avoid a sweet snack before a meal - It triggers the appetite, and you end up eating more of it.
4. Alternate between fruit and non-sweet foods - This will keep the taste of sweetness from sticking around in your mouth too long, which will make it easier to resist going for more sweets later at the office or when you're out with friends.
5. Chew gum or drink water - Simply chewing gum or drinking water can help release some of the sugar in your mouth so that when you reach for an unhealthy snack, later, there's not as much in your mouth to be tempted by.

Certain things are just normal, like food cravings. This is especially true when it comes to sweets. Food cravings are not the only thing that can lead to obesity.

We all deserve a little treat now and then, but it is essential not to go overboard. Too much of anything might be bad for our health in the long run. So, try to eat sweets in moderation. There is nothing wrong with having a sugar craving once in a while - as long as you know how to deal with it properly!
