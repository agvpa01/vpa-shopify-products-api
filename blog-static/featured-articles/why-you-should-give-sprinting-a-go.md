Differences Between Sprinting and Jogging

Sprinting is also known to help burn calories long after your session, this is called excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC). Jogging doesn’t have these same benefits. It also helps form your abs and improve your core structure due to the intense pace your body is moving at.

If building muscle is your goal, then adding in high-intensity sprinting would also be beneficial. Whereas jogging would be utilized more in warm-ups and getting your cardio in for the week.

Sprinting will increase your heart rate quickly and reach a higher level than if you were jogging and then would start to decrease once you have stopped. As jogging goes for longer at a moderate pace, your heart rate will not reach the same level as if you were sprinting. It would instead increase to a certain level and plateau for the length of the jog. Both jogging and sprinting give different benefits but both improving your cardiovascular system.

If you have never given sprinting a go, definitely try it out. It can be more enjoyable than jogging as you can push yourself harder and have lots of small breaks. Remember to always do a good warm-up before starting so your body is ready to run at a fast intensity, and most of all, have fun with pushing yourself towards your goal.
