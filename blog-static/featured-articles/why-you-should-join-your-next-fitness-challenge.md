Have you ever joined a fitness challenge? Challenges help push people forward and help you improve physical health in the process. Often, challenges are structured to push the participant beyond their comfort zone and encourage them to achieve goals they never thought they could reach. If you're still hesitant about joining one, here are a couple more reasons why you should:

## You'll have a goal to work towards

We are all aware that exercise, [together with supplements](https://www.vpa.com.au/collections/supplements-for-weight-loss) is beneficial to our health. It helps us lose weight, increases our stamina and strength, and [reduces our risk of developing serious health conditions like diabetes](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/managing/active.html#:~:text=If%20you%20have%20diabetes%2C%20being,heart%20disease%20and%20nerve%20damage.).

But even with all that knowledge, it can be hard to stick to an exercise routine. We're all busy, and sometimes it's hard to find the time to hit the gym or go for a run. It can even be tedious, especially when you do it alone. Thankfully, there are ways to make exercise more fun and effective — and one of them is joining a fitness challenge.

Fitness challenges can help you stay motivated and reach your goals faster. The competitive aspect of the challenge can help you push yourself harder in each workout, so you'll burn more calories and get into shape more quickly. And having a goal to work towards will help you keep exercising regularly until you've reached your target weight or body fat percentage.

## You'll get inspired by the other people

When you're part of a team, you'll get inspired by the other people in the group, and you'll be motivated to stay on track with your fitness goals. And when you do well, those around you will celebrate your success.

When you participate in a challenge, you'll have the opportunity to meet new people with similar interests. You'll also have built-in support for staying on track with your fitness goals.

You will also get inspired by the other people who are participating in the challenge. That's one of the best things about working out with others — there are always stories of personal triumphs and setbacks that will help motivate you and keep you going when life gets tough.

You'll be part of something bigger than yourself. It can be really powerful to know that you're doing the same thing as hundreds (or thousands) of other people all over Australia. You'll feel like part of a community instead of just trying to work out on your own.

## You'll be held accountable

You'll be held accountable. Whether it's just showing up to workouts or making healthy food choices, being part of a group will hold you responsible for your actions. That's why so many people join fitness challenges like VPA® Australia's 8-week fitness challenge — they want the sense of community that comes from working out with others who are on the same path as them.

You'll push yourself harder. When you work out by yourself, it's easy to quit early or slack off when things get tough. But when you have a group pushing you forward and encouraging you to keep going, it's much easier to stay focused and keep pushing yourself.

## You'll learn new things

Fitness challenges often have great support and loads of information. Companies would often release guides that can help you during the challenge. This means you may learn new exercises and may even learn a new recipe or two. That's not all, though.

One of the most rewarding aspects of taking on a fitness challenge is that you're bound to learn a thing or two about yourself. This journey will be filled with lots of new information and experiences that you can take with you into your everyday life.

## You'll build confidence

Whether it's the first time you've set foot in the gym or you're an avid workout warrior, most people could use a little more confidence in their fitness journey. A fitness challenge provides many opportunities to build your self-esteem and feel good about yourself. As the challenge unfolds, you may be surprised by your strength, flexibility, and overall progress. As you continue to push yourself and discover new limits, it's a surefire way to gain confidence in the gym – and beyond.

If you put in the hard work and dedication, fitness challenges can be immensely beneficial. Not only do they spark a sense of motivation and competitiveness in your life, but they can lead to some long-term benefits for your physical well-being. And if you're currently looking for a challenge to join, we suggest starting with the [VPA® Australia's 8-week challenge](https://www.vpa.com.au/pages/8-week-challenge) — this should be one for the history books!
