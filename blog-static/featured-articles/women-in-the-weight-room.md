### Here are a few reasons why women ought to be doing more weight training.

1. **More muscle mass = higher metabolism**

The most common misconception is that the best way to weight loss is by doing tons of cardio. Sure, cardio burns tons of calories during your workout. But weight training causes your body to burn more calories all day, even at rest. We’ve discussed the [pros and cons of cardio versus weight training](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/training/weights-vs-cardio) here to help you decide.

**Bottom-line:** Weight lifting burns fat and transforms your figure in many ways cardio can’t.

2. **Hitting aesthetic goals**

Most women fall back into the idea that lifting weights will make them look bulky. Ladies, we don’t turn into Arnie after a few weight training sessions! Lifting weights strengthens the muscles. We don’t bulk up the same way men do because it is simply not part of our female genetic makeup.

Lifting heavy helps you achieve the sculpted body we all envy, can build the ideal glutes, and build that perfect hour-glass figure. It’s a lot of consistent physical work and eating to aid in muscle growth which means incorporating more protein into your diet.
