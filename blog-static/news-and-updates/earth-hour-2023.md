### What is Earth Hour?

Every year on the last Saturday of March, individuals, households, communities, and businesses across the world switch off their lights for 60 mins as a gesture of solidarity and support for our planet’s future.

### How Did it Start and What is the Impact?

The WWF initiated Earth Hour back in 2007 where it began as a simple lights-out event. More than 2.2 million individuals and 2000 businesses turned off their lights to show their support.

Today it has extended far wider. In many countries the event has influenced climate policies, successfully pushed for bans on plastics, lead to global tree-planting events, built awareness and inspired people to switch to more sustainable lifestyles, and lead to the installation of solar power in many communities.

### How Can I Participate?

The simplest way to get involved in Earth Hour 2023 is to join others in turning off your lights at the time listed below:

- Brisbane (QLD) 8:30pm – 9:30pm
- Sydney (NSW) 8:30pm – 9:30pm
- Melbourne (VIC) 8:30pm – 9:30pm
- Hobart (TAS) 8:30pm – 9:30pm
- Darwin (NT) 8:00pm – 9:00pm
- Adelaide (SA) 8:00pm – 9:00pm
- Perth (WA) 6:30pm – 7:30pm

### How Can I Do More?

There are many ways in which you can go beyond the hour to shape a brighter future for our planet. Some include:

- Eating more sustainably
- Waste less food
- Travel responsibly
- Reduce/eliminate plastics
- Save water
- Be energy-efficient
- Protect natural spaces
- Be a conscious consumer
- Spread the word

You can also choose to register online and/or organize your own Earth Hour event. Additionally, social media is a powerful tool so spread the word at #EarthHour.

At VPA® our manufacturing plant and HQ is 100% solar powered, we are in the process of switching out plastic scoops in some of our supplements, and we use recyclable cardboard boxes and bottles. [Click here to learn more about how to recycle VPA® packaging](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/news-and-updates/recycling?_pos=1&_sid=7b1dd94bb&_ss=r). Additionally, we source ingredients from suppliers who themselves practice environmental protection policies at their manufacturing sites (e.g. wastewater treatment, recycling etc).

So this Saturday 25th March join us and other households across the world to turn all non-essential lights off for 60 mins and spread the word at #EarthHour. Yes, it’s that easy! Take the time to push out a candlelight workout, zone down with ZMA6, or shake up some premium plant protein, all in the name of supporting our planet’s future.
