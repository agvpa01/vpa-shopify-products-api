Whether you know someone who’s a CrossFit junkie, a bodybuilder, a marathon runner, or even someone who just loves wellness and exercise in general, this list is worth a look. Here are five of the greatest Christmas gifts for fitness lovers:

### 1. Fitness Tracking Tools

VPA® Athlete, **Luke Douglass** recommends the [Garmin Watch](https://www.garmin.com/en-AU/) saying, “It’s versatile in all aspects of health and fitness.
