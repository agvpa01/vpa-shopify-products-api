## Have enough stock on hand and keep it visible

Keeping well stocked with a range of products is the number one way to sell more VPA® products in your gym. People buy what they see, so keeping your stock visible and on display is very important.

Additionally, when clients are at the gym, they are already in the mindset of thinking about their health. Seeing VPA® products will help remind them that they nearly out of protein and prompt them to buy.

Finally, people love convenience. They would rather purchase from you at the gym, than order online or shop elsewhere. If you have stock, and they can see it, they will purchase from you.

Here’s a couple of examples of how you can display our products. Some promotional banners and materials you might want to add to your display include:

- [VPA® Display Stand](https://www.vpa.com.au/collections/promotional-products/products/wholesale-cardboard-stands)
- [VPA® Removable Panels](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/vpa-removable-panels-elevate-your-training)
- [VPA® Protein Comparison Chart](https://wholesale.vpa.com.au/products/wholesale-protein-comparison-chart)

## Educate your clients about VPA® Australia

We know we are the best supplement company in Australia, and hopefully you do to. However, your clients may not be as well informed as you are. Be sure to inform your clients WHY they should choose VPA® Australia Supplements.

**If you need your memory jogged, here’s some quick VPA® Australia facts:**

- **VPA® Australia is fully Australian-owned**. We blend all of our supplements in our north Brisbane production facility.
- All of our whey-based proteins are **sourced from Australian and New Zealand** suppliers to ensure the highest quality end products.
- Our protein powders, BCAA and aminos **do not have any fillers or unnecessary ingredients**. This is why no other protein brand will have a higher protein content per serve for comparable products.
- **Our products are safe**. We do not use any banned ingredients in any of our products. Our products are regularly independently tested to ensure they do not contain banned substances and that they are ASADA / WADA compliant.

## Educate your clients about supplements

Your customers all train and come to the gym or your store for different reasons, and they are all at different stages of their health and fitness journey. Many of your clients may have little understanding of supplements are and how they can benefit from taking them.

## Provide your clients with free samples

Providing samples and tastings are one of the most effective ways of selling more VPA® supplements in your gym. You can provide VPA® product samples to your customers in two ways.

Samples can be used in three different ways:
