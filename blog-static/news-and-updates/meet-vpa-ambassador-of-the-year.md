## After putting a call out in December to find VPA® Australia’s Ambassador of the Year 2020, we were overwhelmed by the high quality entrants. However, one entry stood out to the entire VPA® team. We are excited to announce that our 2020 Ambassador of the year is Antony Nobilo

Working in finance by day, Tony says his friends describe his training style as ‘Old School’. He likes to combine weights with functional bootcamp style training. His favourite body part to train is, legs, hitting them at least two times a week. He definitely never skips leg day! You can find him training at either [Barry’s Bootcamp](https://www.barrysbootcamp.com.au/) in the city in the mornings, or Anytime Fitness with the odd session at [Massive Workouts](https://www.massiveworkouts.com.au) in Wetherill Park, Sydney.

> I’ve been training for the last 20 years, and I train hard at each and every session. My motto is **Go Hard or Go Home!**

As a body building competitor, Tony has competed within the [ANB](https://anb.com.au) and [ICN](http://icompeteaustralia.com.au) federations in the Fitness Model Category. In 2018 he won first place in ANB NSW +35YO bracket, 1st in the September 2018 ANB National +35YO bracket, and 2nd in the April 2019 ICN International +40YO bracket. These results have required unwavering determination and discipline in both his diet and training.

Tony has been a loyal VPA® customer for a long time. His favourite supplements are [VPA® WPC](/products/premium-whey-wpc), [Collagen Pro](/products/collagen-pro)® for joints, [Multi Greens](/products/multi-greens) and [BCAA7000](/products/bcaa-7000).
Tony is currently preparing for another competition in September 2020, which federation is still to be determined, where he is being coached by Mike Dorn, 4x IFBB Mr. Australia.
We are so pleased to welcome Tony to the team as VPA® Australia’s Ambassador of the Year 2020. We look forward to the fantastic content he will provide over the coming year.
