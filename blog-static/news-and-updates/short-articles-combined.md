Anytime Fitness Lawnton

Keeping well stocked with a range of products is the number one way to sell more VPA® products in your gym. People buy what they see, so keeping your stock visible and on display is very important.

Additionally, when clients are at the gym, they are already in the mindset of thinking about their health. Seeing VPA® products will help remind them that they nearly out of protein and prompt them to buy.

Finally, people love convenience. They would rather purchase from you at the gym, than order online or shop elsewhere. If you have stock, and they can see it, they will purchase from you.

Here’s a couple of examples of how you can display our products. Some promotional banners and materials you might want to add to your display include:

- [VPA® Display Stand](https://www.vpa.com.au/collections/promotional-products/products/wholesale-cardboard-stands)
- [VPA® Removable Panels](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/vpa-removable-panels-elevate-your-training)
- [VPA® Protein Comparison Chart](https://wholesale.vpa.com.au/products/wholesale-protein-comparison-chart)

Want to start stocking VPA® products? Apply for wholesale today.

## Educate your clients about VPA® Australia

We know we are the best supplement company in Australia, and hopefully you do to. However, your clients may not be as well informed as you are. Be sure to inform your clients WHY they should choose VPA® Australia Supplements.

**If you need your memory jogged, here’s some quick VPA® Australia facts:**

- **VPA® Australia is fully Australian-owned**. We blend all of our supplements in our north Brisbane production facility.
- All of our whey-based proteins are **sourced from Australian and New Zealand** suppliers to ensure the highest quality end products.
- Our protein powders, BCAA and aminos **do not have any fillers or unnecessary ingredients**. This is why no other protein brand will have a higher protein content per serve for comparable products.
- **Our products are safe**. We do not use any banned ingredients in any of our products. Our products are regularly independently tested to ensure they do not contain banned substances and that they are ASADA / WADA compliant.

You can also check out [Our Story over here](/pages/about-us), to learn more about us.

## Educate your clients about supplements

Your customers all train and come to the gym or your store for different reasons, and they are all at different stages of their health and fitness journey. Many of your clients may have little understanding of supplements are and how they can benefit from taking them.

As a personal trainer or business owner who stocks VPA® products, we know you already hold this knowledge so have a nice occasional chat to your customers to help direct them to the right supplements they are already looking to buy from you.

---

## Provide your clients with free samples

Providing samples and tastings are one of the most effective ways of selling more VPA® supplements in your gym. You can provide VPA® product samples to your customers in two ways.

We offer sample packs to VPA® wholesalers at a wholesaler's price. [You can find them here.](https://wholesale.vpa.com.au/products)

Samples can be used in three different ways:

- You can on-sell them to your clients who are after a single serve of product when they forget to bring their own to the gym.
- You can hand them out to clients when they first sign up with you so they can learn for themselves just how good our products taste.
- Alternativ...

## Content

### Release Date: May 2020

The VPA® order tracker is an efficient and faster way for you to track your orders.

### What’s new?

- Receive images of your package as soon as it is packed! Thanks to our amazing IT staff, we will now email you an image of your order as soon as it’s packed by our dispatch team. (images are sent out every 2 hrs so please be patient).
- Order tracking – you will be able to view the status of your order on our website as well as click on a link to go directly to the couriers tracking page for your order to see if they are any delays/issues etc.
- Reorder functionality – you asked and we listened. You can now reorder (items will be added to your cart) from prior orders to make checkout even faster!

### Where do I find the VPA® Order Tracker?

- [Login to your “My Account”](https://vpa-australia.myshopify.com/account/login) section to view your order/s.

### I ordered over 20kg but I only received one image?

Due to the restrictions in our algorithm only your first package image will be sent out to you so don’t stress. For large orders (including wholesale) orders, you will only receive the image for your first carton.

### Does this apply to wholesale orders as well as retail orders?

- Yes. Please note that F45 and Anytime Fitness email servers do have size restrictions on some attachments so images may not come through.

### Where do you get the status updates from?

- We use an API connected to our couriers ([Fastway](https://www.fastway.com.au/) and [Australia Post](https://auspost.com.au/)) to get status updates, so unfortunately we are at the whim of our couriers in terms of information that we can provide.

### Does this apply to international orders as well?

- Yes it does.

**SEO Title:** VPA is not an Instagram hype company

**SEO Description:** What is social media hype? Here's what you need to know. We're here to assure you that VPA is not an Instagram hype company and never will be.

---

## Excerpt

### If you’re connected to most social media networks you should definitely run into a couple of brands and products that are in the business of hype. Unfortunately, the “hype” eventually dies down and you’re left spending on a product that often falls short. We’re here to assure you that **VPA® is not an Instagram hype company** and never will be.
By the end of this short read, you’ll be able to tell them right off the bat. So listen up, here’s our lowdown on these Instagram “hype” companies.

---

## What makes an Instagram “hype” company?

- **Overpriced product:** If instant coffee costs $20 a bottle and you’re paying $70 for the same number of serves, you’re purchasing from an Instagram “hype” company. The extra margin that they charge for their product goes into their marketing spend to keep “paying for the hype” to be sustained.
- **Large amount spent on influencers:** big name influencers request large pay checks (eg. [Fyre Festival](https://www.businessinsider.com/fyre-festival-expectations-vs-reality-2017-4)). The hype will build really quickly but also fall just as fast.
- **Little investment on infrastructure and tangible assets:** Amazon doesn’t invest in hype, they invest in technology, people and huge warehouses. Like REALLY big warehouses. Google doesn’t invest in hype. Uber doesn’t invest in hype…ok you’re getting the picture.
- **All over Instagram and other social media channels:** self explanatory (See above)

---

## Why do Instagram hype companies fail?

- Easy – they “hype” ALWAYS dies down.
- You cannot maintain a healthy Profit and Loss (actual or normalised) by spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on hype/influencers.
- Instagram hype companies will ALWAYS fail.

---

## What about “Californian burger chains” and “American companies that sell white shirts for $200 with their logos emblazoned”?

- This is a tough one – the USA is a very unique market (USA = 400 million people with disposable income).
- The companies described above will succeed as long as they maintain scarcity (eg. Very few stores) and continue to spend on their hype budgets ($1M to get their logos tattooed onto NBA players etc).

---

## But don’t you guys spend money on influencers?

- Yes, but we’re not purchasing “hype”.
- [Our ambassadors](/pages/team-vpa) and athletes are carefully handpicked by our team and must “use our product” and believe in our product. Our ambassadors receive our product each month to promote if and only if they truly believe in the VPA® brand. If not, we politely ask them to move on.
- If they appeared on [MAFS](https://www.facebook.com/MAFS/) that’s great, but we’re not going to pay them large sums of money (cash for comments) to use their “celebrity” to promote our products. This also goes for sporting stars and partners. If they do not use our product each day, we politely ask them to move on.

---

## Are you falling for hype companies?

- Purchased some ready to go meal kits or meals that were all over Instagram?
- Purchased any new mattresses that utilize NASA technology?
- Purchased some overpriced coffee?
- Purchased any protein powder for $70/kg+?

If you answered yes, to any of the above, then you’ve been conned by the “hype” bug. No need to turn off social media, just ask yourself the question “Am I paying for hype”?
Please feel free to share this page with friends that need to hear this message.

---

## Our promise to you

VPA® is not an Instagram hype company and never will be.
You are receiving the best product at the best possible pricing when you are shopping at VPA®.
You are not (and will never be) paying exorbitant amounts of money to influencers to build hype on social media.

### There is nothing like seeing a healthy lifestyle come full circle. By this we mean choosing to nourish your body with the best and choosing what’s good for the environment because well, feeling good and doing good comes hand in hand.

Since the pandemic, the world has seen a surge of more people opting to shop online than before and [Australia Post’s 2020 report](https://auspost.com.au/content/dam/auspost_corp/media/documents/2020-ecommerce-industry-report.pdf) *says this* *new normal is here to stay*. But what does this mean for your packaging after they have safely made it to your doorstep?

If you have noticed the new and fresh look to our packages, good on you! You’ll be happy to know that purchasing with VPA® is good on the environment too. Our team has thought of some great solutions to help give you the peace of mind while keeping healthy and fit.

---

## What's in the bag?

---

### VPA® Cornstarch Mailer-bags

What impact does this package have on the environment? It certainly looks like plastic but this biodegradable mailer is made with cornstarch. Cornstarch is used to create a biopolymer which degrades over time, 24 months to be exact, so it’s certainly a step better than plastic, but it is not compostable.

### How to discard

Simply dispose of this bag in the normal rubbish.

---

### VPA® Carton Boxes

Love VPA® so much you need a big box for your orders? Our carton boxes are made by our good friends from [VISY Australia](https://www.visy.com.au/create-a-better-world). VISY provides Aussie businesses the solution to recycle and close the loop with recyclable packaging.

### How to discard

This means your carton boxes can safely be discarded in the rubbish and you can be at peace knowing they can biodegrade and return to earth in 6 months. What we love about it is that it’s 100% compostable too! It is best to shred or cut them into smaller pieces for easier and faster composting.

---

### VPA® Protein Powder Bags

Our protein powder zip bags are built to give your supplements the best environment to always keep it fresh. Although they are plastic, VPA® has partnered with [REDCycle](https://www.redcycle.net.au/partners/) to provide you with recycling solutions to keep plastic waste out from landfills.

REDCycle does awesome work as they process discarded plastics in their facility and deliver them to [Replas](http://www.replas.com.au/) to transform plastic waste into useful items such as park benches, fitness equipment, outdoor furniture, bollards, signages and much more.

VPA® is one among the many Australian brands that have partnered with REDCycle. As a responsible consumer, we encourage you to check out [Where to REDcycle](https://www.redcycle.net.au/where-to-redcycle/), and find out what household items you may include and find the drop-off point and REDCycle bins nearest to you.

Lockdowns are tough times for businesses but we’re lucky enough to be living at a time where technology is at its peak – people are able to work from home, kids can attend online classes, apps are available to provide home deliveries and gyms can now offer online workouts. With millions of people staying home and practicing social distancing, keeping fit and healthy while indoors don’t have to be a challenge. Here are some tips to supplement your income during quarantine over the next few months, as you adapt to our new norm as we fight through this pandemic together:

---

## 1. Make use of fitness training apps

From the convenience of your smartphone, you can manage your client’s workouts, tasks, meal plans, schedule, payments, and more all in one app. There are many apps available so you just need to choose the best fit for you. Fitness coaches and gyms can also see whether their clients completed their workouts, stayed on track with their goals, and countless other aspects that are so vital to running a fitness business. We did the research so you don’t have to – below are the top 3 on our list:

| Training Apps | Pricing | Key features |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FitSW [www.fitsw.com](http://www.fitsw.com) | Has access up to 60 clients in a session<br>Has a free plan<br>Pricing ranges from $8.33 to $41.66 per month | Training templates<br>Workout builder<br>Client monitoring<br>Create fitness targets<br>Meal and macros tracker |
| Trainerize | Has access up to 30 clients in a session<br>Has a free plan<br>Pricing ranges from $4.50 to $54 per month | Client workout logging Custom metrics and goals Progress and nutrition tracking |
| Truecoach [www.truecoach.co](http://www.truecoach.co) | Has access up to 30 clients in a session<br>Has a free plan<br>Pricing ranges from $19 to $99 per month | Workout builder Exercise library Nutrition and meal planning Scheduling and calendar Progress photo Custom branding |

All of these have in-app messaging and video calling features. In addition, if you don’t mind doing all the hard work, we’re already seeing plenty of gyms inviting their clients to do online classes via Zoom meeting – [www.zoom.us](http://www.zoom.us)

---

## 2. Build your online presence

A broad range of online platforms await from Facebook to Instagram, YouTube, or even TikTok. You can choose one or all of them to let people know that your business, whilst physically closed, is very much active. Share your home workout videos or practice those TikTok dance moves. Post your healthy meals of the day, share recipes, and build a community out of it. As you do, collaborate with your favorite brands, reach out to them and ask if you can get a few products to host a giveaway to your online community. Brands usually won’t mind as it will help promote their products, too.

---

## 3. Start a YouTube Fitness Channel and monetize your videos

It’s free and all you have to do is learn the basics – learn how to edit videos, research on content that best works on YouTube and get started. Content that fits best for health and fitness would be full workout sessions, cooking videos, quarantine vlogs to fit our current climate, a day in the life of … and many more. Follow YouTubers that you’ve long been following and get inspiration from what they’re already doing and what works for them. Monetize your videos once you’ve met YouTube’s requirements. Best advice is to mainly do it for fun!

---

## 4. Offer meal plans or meal services

A great way to provide variety and to help your clients stay disciplined despite on lockdown. Give them a sense of direction by helping them personalize their meal plans based on their fitness goals. If you love cooking, offering meal services and home delivery whilst maintaining a 1.5m distance will be a win-win for both you and your clients.

---

## 5. Lease out your gym equipment

With the right terms and conditions in place, this might be a great idea in times of lockdowns and social distancing. After reading a few comments from people saying it’s just not worth bu...

### VPA® Australia changed names for legal reasons

Unfortunately from time to time, mis-information is sometimes a part of business. In light of this we have created this page to bust any myths in relation to the VPA® Australia brand.

If you would like clarification to anything in relation to the VPA® Australia brand, please feel free to fill out this [form](https://vpa.fit/anti-competitive-behaviour) or call us on 1300 669 264. We have a team of customer service staff (M-F 9am-4.30pm) that are more than willing to answer your queries and quash any misinformation that you may have received. For legal clarification we may also request the source of said information.

### VPA® Australia’s prices are lower because they use cheaper ingredients.

Absolutely not. Our name change in 2016 was due to the fact that we were unable to trademark the “Venom” brand in Asia (translates into “poison”, which was deemed against the peace). There was absolutely no change in ownership or malicious reason for our name change. We are now proud to say that VPA® Australia is a registered trademark in 44 countries around the world. See the map below for a full list of countries.

### VPA® Australia was previously owned by Redbak Australia

We have absolutely no affiliation or connection to the Redbak brand in Australia and never have.

Yours in health and fitness,  
VPA Australia

Our team are over- the-moon to have the opportunity to support and work with charities and organisations that we truly believe in and that make a genuine impact in our community.

### Charities we support

### Bushfire Appeal

Early this year, Australia faced one of the most devastating bushfire crises. As the world came together to help in this time of need, the VPA® Australia team had also organised a fund-raiser to raise funds for our firefighters and communities directly impacted by the widespread and devastating bushfires.

VPA® had matched donations dollar for dollar. And together with your generosity, our community was able to raise $1567 and VPA® has donated $10,000.

We have given the funds to [The Rural Fire Service (RFS)](https://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/) and [The Salvation Army](https://www.salvationarmy.org.au/).

[See our VPA® Heroes.](https://www.vpa.com.au/2020-bush-fire-appeal)

If you still wish to donate, please see the links on the page provided.

### Clean Up Australia Day

The VPA® team is strongly committed to reducing plastic waste as well as promoting the [recycling of our VPA® bags](/blogs/news-and-updates/vpa-bags-are-now-100-recyclable) by partnering up with REDcycle last year to make a positive difference in the community and our environment.

This year, our team organized a beach clean up at the Redcliffe Beach to which we found an incredible amount of plastics.

## VPA® Australia Management Briefing

VPA® Australia management have been briefed this week by [DFAT](https://www.dfat.gov.au/), [Trade Investment Queensland](https://www.tiq.qld.gov.au/), and the [Australian China Business Council](http://www.acbc.com.au) as to the current and ongoing risks and complications posed by the [coronavirus outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_outbreak). We are briefed multiple times a week by Queensland Health regarding what VPA® needs to be doing to mitigate the risk to our staff.

## If Covid-19 is similar to the flu, why is there so much concern?

- At this stage there is no commercially available vaccine for Coronavirus.
- Covid-19 has a higher mortality and hospitalization rate compared to the flu. It poses a very high risk to the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions. For every death, DFAT estimates 5 intensive care and 20 hospital beds to be filled.
- The mutation and life-cycle of the virus is unknown.
- Coronavirus poses a large commercial risk. There will be a huge impact on supply chains for virtually every company on the planet. Without accurate data/forecasts as to when these delays will abate. These risks have gone to countries outside of Asia, including European countries and Australia.

## How will the Coronavirus / Covid-19 affect VPA®?

Here are a few examples of issues which VPA® will/may face over the next 3-12 months.

### Packaging:

- We may experience delays in production and shipping from our usual suppliers. VPA® will mitigate this risk by having generic packaging on hand to use if needed.
- Australian manufacturers of scoops and plastic bottles will also be affected as most supply chains originate in China for raw material for these products.
- Please be patient and understanding as some items “may” arrive in generic packaging (properly marked with FSANZ appropriate labeling) in the latter half of the year.

### Amino acid supply:

- We are pleased to say that NONE of our suppliers are located in the Wuhan region.
- Our current suppliers for amino acids have and will continue to experience delays. We deal with large pharmaceutical manufacturers that supply much of the world's formulated supplementary foods market so these supply chains may be disrupted resulting in price increases for these products.

### Accessories and Apparel:

- These items will have a direct impact in both the short and long term. Many apparel and accessory items are made across mainland China and distributed through large cities such as Beijing and Guangzhou.
- Regardless of which country these products are manufactured in, supply chains will be disrupted and prices may increase.

### Capsule and tablet supply:

- We will be discontinuing sales of these products due to new TGA regulations.

### Flavour and Protein Supply:

- There is no immediate threat in both the short and medium term.

### Travel Restrictions:

- VPA® management travel to China and other parts of the world as a part of procurement procedures. This will most likely not occur in 2020.

## Can the coronavirus be spread through food products such as health supplements?

Transmission through food is unlikely and there is no evidence of this occurring with novel coronavirus to date. [See document here](https://www.foodstandards.gov.au/consumer/safety/Pages/NOVEL-CORONAVIRUS-AND-FOOD-SAFETY.aspx) for further information. As an export-grade production facility, VPA® already has the highest hygiene standards in place for our production staff. In addition, VPA® management have introduced several new procedures and policies to minimize the risk to our staff.

## What should we be doing to minimize risk?

Please follow all government advice regarding travel, social-isolation, and attendance at places and events. This advice is updated almost daily and this is why VPA® is not relaying it here.

**SEO Title:** TGA Round Table: February 14, 2020

**SEO Description:** TGA discusses "Proposed clarification that certain sports supplements are therapeutic goods" consultation paper. How will this effect VPA products?

---

## Excerpt

No excerpt available

## Content

### VPA® Australia Presentation by TGA

---

#### What are the proposed changes?

- Click this link to view the original [consultation paper](https://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/consultation-sports-supplements.pdf) (dated October 2019).
- **Note:** The decision tree for whether a product is classified as a therapeutic good has already been updated. (see image below)

---

#### Summary (in layman’s terms):

- For the most part, Sports Supplements are classified as “Foods” as per Food Standards Australian and New Zealand. To be specific “Formulated Supplementary Sports Foods”.
- The TGA believes that some of these supplements should be classified as “therapeutics goods” due to claims and/or ingredients and form (capsules & tablets).

---

#### Who/what will this affect the most?

- Any supplements that contain WADA or ASADA non-compliant ingredients.
- All Australian manufacturers.
- All products that make therapeutic claims.
- Changes are to be put before parliament circa May 2020.

---

#### Why is this change required (as put forward by the TGA)?

- The TGA believes that for the greater good of the population, there needs to be greater regulation, in relation to the claims made by “formulated supplementary sports foods”.
- Extreme examples provided by TGA.

---

#### Myth busters:

- “All claims” will classify products as therapeutic = MYTH.
- Any Caffeine product with high levels of caffeine will be classified as therapeutic = MYTH.

---

#### Questions that were not answered or still to be answered:

- Various questions regarding enforcement, monopolies, method of delivery manipulation, etc.

---

#### How will this affect VPA® products?

- As it stands, the proposed TGA changes will not affect VPA® products in their current formulations.
- Capsules and tablets will be assessed on a line by line basis to assess the ROI that they provide in relation to the registration costs.

---

#### Why are all tablets/capsules/pills classified as therapeutic?

- The TGA proposes that the “man on the bondi tram” believes that something in capsule form is medicinal in nature. VPA® agrees somewhat or more accurately doesn’t have a counter argument/study to propose otherwise.

---

##### Please note the comments on this page are provided for the users of our website (www.vpa.com.au) and stakeholders. It is informational in nature.

##### Please seek professional advice for issues pertinent to yourself or company.

### After putting a call out in December to find VPA® Australia’s Ambassador of the Year 2020, we were overwhelmed by the high quality entrants. However, one entry stood out to the entire VPA® team.  We are excited to announce that our 2020 Ambassador of the year is Antony Nobilo

Working in finance by day, Tony says his friends describe his training style as ‘Old School’. He likes to combine weights with functional bootcamp style training. His favourite body part to train is, legs, hitting them at least two times a week. He definitely never skips leg day! You can find him training at either [Barry’s Bootcamp](https://www.barrysbootcamp.com.au/) in the city in the mornings, or Anytime Fitness with the odd session at [Massive Workouts](https://www.massiveworkouts.com.au) in Wetherill Park, Sydney.

> I’ve been training for the last 20 years, and I train hard at each and every session. My motto is **Go Hard or Go Home!**

As a body building competitor, Tony has competed within the [ANB](https://anb.com.au) and [ICN](http://icompeteaustralia.com.au) federations in the Fitness Model Category. In 2018 he won first place in ANB NSW +35YO bracket, 1st in the September 2018 ANB National +35YO bracket, and 2nd in the April 2019 ICN International +40YO bracket. These results have required unwavering determination and discipline in both his diet and training.

Tony has been a loyal VPA® customer for a long time. His favourite supplements are [VPA® WPC](/products/premium-whey-wpc), [Collagen Pro](/products/collagen-pro)® for joints, [Multi Greens](/products/multi-greens) and [BCAA7000](/products/bcaa-7000).
Tony is currently preparing for another competition in September 2020, which federation is still to be determined, where he is being coached by Mike Dorn, 4x IFBB Mr. Australia.
We are so pleased to welcome Tony to the team as VPA® Australia’s Ambassador of the Year 2020. We look forward to the fantastic content he will provide over the coming year.

**SEO Title:** A few things to know before joining the gym

**SEO Description:** Are you planning to join a gym or fitness centre in 2020? Here's a few things to know before joining a gym and signing on the dotted line.

---

## Excerpt

No excerpt available

### Your consumer rights and responsibilities

Are you planning to join a gym or fitness centre in 2020? Or are you already a part of one? Having access to a place with an active and lively community that inspires you to get stronger and train can be a great stepping stone for leveling up your life. It could be really exciting to start your fitness journey in a snap, especially when you’ve walked through the doors and have already soaked in everyone else’s endorphins and positivity. But like always, take the time to read the contract carefully as it can save you all the fuss. This blog will run you through a few things you should know before joining the gym.

---

### Cooling-off Period

The fitness industry is regulated in Australia, and gyms must offer you a 48-hour cooling-off period after you’ve signed the contract or started. This comes in handy when you’re still feeling out the gym. After all, don’t buy a car without test driving it, right? If something comes up, remember you can change your mind about your membership within 48 hours. If you must cancel the agreement, you should be able to notify the gym in writing within the 48-hour period.

---

#### Membership Fees

Everything should be transparent. The contract must outline the total fees and charges for the length of your membership.

---

#### Keep an eye out for the following:

- Your right to end the agreement if you suffer a permanent sickness or injury.
- Any other reasons you can end the agreement before it expires, for example an out clause, in case you move, lose your job, etc. Often you can get out of a contract if you move a certain number of miles from the club without a fee, but usually, any other item requires an “early termination fee” to get out of your contract.
- Can you freeze your contract if you go out of town or are on vacation?
- Can you transfer your membership to another fitness centre or person?
- What happens if the club goes out of business?
- Does the membership renew automatically?
- What’s the process to end the agreement?
- The opening date (if you sign up before they open for business)

---

#### Regular Fees

Questions you might want to ask:

- How much is the first time joining fee?
- How much is the regular membership? (as opposed to memberships rolled out during promo season)
- How much is the entry fee per visit?
- How much are the fees for other services or gym programs?

---

### Discounts

When your gym offers you free or discounted fitness services in your membership. Of course, take it! Just don’t forget to run through the fine print.

Questions you might want to ask:

- How much does the service usually cost?
- Have they increased/decreased their usual fee before the offer?

### 3. Gym Gear & Bags

**SEO Title:** VPA Bags are now 100% recyclable!

**SEO Description:** How to recycle VPA Packaging

---

## Excerpt

No excerpt available

---

## Content

## Reuse and Recycle!

Thank you for taking the first step in sustainably disposing of our packaging! Chances are you’ve just reached the bottom of your VPA product and are thinking “what do I do now?”. Well first get on our website and order more – that’s a no brainer! But secondly, let’s be kind to our planet and dispose of the packaging in the most suitable way.

---

### Scoops

VPA is currently in the process of removing scoops from some of our single ingredient supps in a bid to reduce our plastic usage. However, some products will still have the classic green VPA scoop. These scoops are made of PP (Polypropylene) which is also used to make ice cream and yoghurt containers. These can be recycled using your kerbside recycling bin. Same goes for our small white scoops.

---

### Supps Bottles

If you’ve tried one of our blended supplements such as BCAAs, pre-workout, collagen, multigreens, protein ball mix, ZMA6 etc, you would have come across our white bottles. These are made up of a combination of PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate), which can be found in soft drink and juice bottles, and PP. These white bottles can also be recycled using your kerbside recycling bin, just make sure they’re empty.

Alternatively, remove the label and reuse your bottles to store pantry ingredients, bulk wholefoods or washing powder.

---

### Bottled Drinks

VPA’s ready-to-drink range uses various types of packaging such as PET plastic bottles and aluminium cans all of which, you guessed it, can be recycled!

---

### Shakers

We’re not sure why you’d be throwing out your plastic VPA shaker but hypothetically let’s say you were, it’s made of PP so pop it in your recycling bin.

---

### Protein Bags

Protein bags are a bit trickier than the rest. They are made up of a combination of PP, PET and LDPE (Low-Density Polyethylene). As mentioned, PP and PET can be recycled however LDPE, which you’ll know from plastic shopping bags, bin liners and zip-lock bags, can’t be recycled at home.

Prior to Nov 2022 these soft flexible plastics were recycled into furniture, fencing and road-based infrastructure through a program called REDcycle, however this has temporarily been paused. New solutions are currently being investigated (e.g. Curby) but for now soft plastics go in with the regular rubbish.

Alternatively, wash and dry out your protein bag and reuse it for frozen fruit and veg, or to store dry pantry items.

At VPA we want to support our planet’s future so join us and dispose of your packaging thoughtfully by reusing or recycling it.

Thank you for taking the first step in sustainably disposing of our packaging! Chances are you’ve just reached the bottom of your VPA® product and are thinking “what do I do now?”. Well first get on our website and order more – that’s a no brainer! But secondly, let’s be kind to our planet and dispose of the packaging in the most suitable way.

### We are so happy to announce that VPA® is now the proud supplement supplier and partner of the Queensland Reds.

The performance Dietitian of the QLD Reds (Sally Bauman) was so impressed with the VPA® range and the extent of our testing and certification, she reached out to us to request that we partner with the Reds as their official supplement provider.

"**I really enjoy working with [VPA®](https://www.vpa.com.au/) to understand the different products and how they are formulated so that I know when I am prescribing products to our athletes that they are going to work and also meet all of our requirements. VPA® has been great in ensuring that everything that we are doing is helping our players perform at their highest level." – Sally Beauman.**

Rugby is an extremely physical sport and requires athletes to be in peak physical shape, combining maximum strength with maximum endurance. To help the athletes achieve this performance they stick to strict diets and apart of this diet includes quality supplements designed for their physical needs and goals. Here are the key products that the QLD Reds use on a daily basis:

#### Protein Powders:

- [Whey Isolate](/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder): Used after training for the players who are trying to stay lean or lose body fat since it is so low in calories and delivers a very fast supply of protein after tough workouts.
- [Muscle Gainer](/products/muscle-gainer): For the athletes who are trying to gain weight or burn a lot of calories through the day.

We all know the importance of a good night sleep, with sleep deprivation and low sleep quality causing impaired physical and mental performance. However, with our busy modern lifestyles, achieving a deep and full night sleep can be difficult for some people. Improving sleep hygiene practices such as limiting screen time and caffeine, implementing a relaxing bedtime routine and spending time in the sun can all help improve sleep, but there are also some nutrition hacks you can implement to help you catch some Zzz’s. This blog will outline three reasons taking casein can help improve your sleep.

---

## What is casein?

With so many different types of protein on the market, it can be difficult to understand the benefits of each. Like whey, casein is a type of protein found in cows milk. It is a high quality, bioavailable protein that contains all of the essential amino acids. Unlike whey protein which is rapidly digested, casein is slowly digested and absorbed. This is due to the clumping that occurs when it reaches the acidic environment of our stomachs. The slow digestion of casein provides a sustained release of amino acids into the blood stream, which in turn provides the building materials for muscle repair and growth.

---

## How does taking casein improve sleep?

### Diets high in protein can improve sleep quality

Studies have suggested that diets high in protein result in fewer periods of waking throughout the night when compared to higher carbohydrate diets. Taking casein before bed can increase your dietary protein intake and help improve your sleep.

### Casein keeps you feeling full

Choosing casein instead of whey in the evenings will result in a slow release of protein throughout the night. This keeps overnight hunger at bay and decreasing sleep restlessness. This aspect of casein would be of most benefit to those who are losing weight on a calorie deficit and more prone to before bed and night time hunger.

### Casein contains tryptophan

Tryptophan is an amino acid that forms the building block of many proteins, including casein. Studies have found that a small dose of tryptophan (1g) improves sleep quality due to acting as a precursor to the relaxing neurotransmitter 5-HT which in turn is a precursor to melatonin. Although the mechanisms are not fully understood, evidence shows that this small dose of tryptophan can improve the speed at which someone falls asleep and the quality of that sleep.

So there you have the three reasons taking casein can help improve your sleep. If you’ve decided that you could benefit from including casein in your supplement stack, VPA® has you covered. You can buy our [micellar casein](/products/micellar-casein), or if you like a sweet treat try our [protein mousse](/products/protein-mousse-500g) which comes in three delicious flavours.

### What is Earth Hour?
Every year on the last Saturday of March, individuals, households, communities, and businesses across the world switch off their lights for 60 mins as a gesture of solidarity and support for our planet’s future.

### How Did it Start and What is the Impact?
The WWF initiated Earth Hour back in 2007 where it began as a simple lights-out event. More than 2.2 million individuals and 2000 businesses turned off their lights to show their support.

Today it has extended far wider. In many countries the event has influenced climate policies, successfully pushed for bans on plastics, lead to global tree-planting events, built awareness and inspired people to switch to more sustainable lifestyles, and lead to the installation of solar power in many communities.

### How Can I Participate?
The simplest way to get involved in Earth Hour 2023 is to join others in turning off your lights at the time listed below:

- Brisbane (QLD) 8:30pm – 9:30pm
- Sydney (NSW) 8:30pm – 9:30pm
- Melbourne (VIC) 8:30pm – 9:30pm
- Hobart (TAS) 8:30pm – 9:30pm
- Darwin (NT) 8:00pm – 9:00pm
- Adelaide (SA) 8:00pm – 9:00pm
- Perth (WA) 6:30pm – 7:30pm

### How Can I Do More?
There are many ways in which you can go beyond the hour to shape a brighter future for our planet. Some include:

- Eating more sustainably
- Waste less food
- Travel responsibly
- Reduce/eliminate plastics
- Save water
- Be energy-efficient
- Protect natural spaces
- Be a conscious consumer
- Spread the word

You can also choose to register online and/or organize your own Earth Hour event. Additionally, social media is a powerful tool so spread the word at #EarthHour.

At VPA® our manufacturing plant and HQ is 100% solar powered, we are in the process of switching out plastic scoops in some of our supplements, and we use recyclable cardboard boxes and bottles. [Click here to learn more about how to recycle VPA® packaging](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/news-and-updates/recycling?_pos=1&_sid=7b1dd94bb&_ss=r). Additionally, we source ingredients from suppliers who themselves practice environmental protection policies at their manufacturing sites (e.g. wastewater treatment, recycling etc).

So this Saturday 25th March join us and other households across the world to turn all non-essential lights off for 60 mins and spread the word at #EarthHour. Yes, it’s that easy! Take the time to push out a candlelight workout, zone down with ZMA6, or shake up some premium plant protein, all in the name of supporting our planet’s future.

Bovaer® has undergone over 15 years of rigorous research and is currently utilised in numerous countries globally, representing a crucial step in reducing the dairy industry's carbon footprint.
