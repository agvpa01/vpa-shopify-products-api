### Pre-30 is now Gold Coast (GC) Stim

With the same great formulation that you know and love, Pre-30 now goes by the name of GC Stim. Taking inspiration from the Gold Coast skyline and Pre-30’s stimulatory effects, the name GC Stim was formed.

GC Stim is a pre-workout supplement made of high-quality ingredients including creatine and AAKG to improve exercise performance, increase strength and build muscle mass. It also has beta alanine and caffeine to boost energy levels and increase reaction time, and citrulline malate to increase nitric oxide (NO) levels for better pumps, endurance and reduced muscle soreness. You’ll also find L-tyrosine for laser focus and B vitamins for energy production.

Whether you’re a high-level athlete, chasing gains at the gym or just looking for that extra edge, accomplish them all with our new look pre-workout GC Stim. Not to mention that it’s available in some exciting new flavours.

### BCAA 7000 is now BUSSIN'

Formerly known as BCAA 7000, BUSSIN is the newly titled intra-workout on the block. With the same high-quality ingredients, formulation, and benefits as before, this supp is so damn good we just had to call it how it is, BUSSIN!

BUSSIN is primarily made up of the amino acids L-Leucine, L-Isoleucine and L-Valine which play an important role in protein synthesis and fast muscle recovery. It also contains citrulline malate which as mentioned may increase NO levels in the body, allowing more blood and nutrients to reach muscles. BUSSIN also contains L-glutamine to help maintain muscle mass during strenuous workout sessions and to improve overall athletic performance.

Support your body to optimize performance and prevent muscle breakdown during training by supplementing with our intra-workout BUSSIN.

Watch out for any new flavours to be released soon!

So, don’t be fooled by the new look, GC Stim and BUSSIN are the same great products you know and love just with a slightly new appearance. They will still give you the muscle and athletic support that you need to pump out those gains.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Why aren’t all products changed immediately?

We want to transition to our new packaging without having to throw out tons of rubbish as this would be against our ethos. So, please bear with us as we finish up with our previous packaging and transition to our bold new look.

#### When will the roll-out be complete?

We estimate complete roll-out for the new GC Stim and BUSSIN packaging by end of the year.

#### I received the old packaging. Does this mean the product is going to expire soon?

Absolutely not. All our proteins have a 24-month expiry date from manufactured date.

#### I’m a VPA stockist. Can I swap BCAA 7000 and PRE-30 products over

Unfortunately not. We cannot swap old and new products due to cost of transportation.

#### But I’ve received both old and new packaging?

Yes, as for the above. We will not be throwing out old stock, in line with our environmental policy.
