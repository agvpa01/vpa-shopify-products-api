### VPA® Australia Presentation by TGA

#### What are the proposed changes?

- Click this link to view the original [consultation paper](https://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/consultation-sports-supplements.pdf) (dated October 2019).
- **Note:** The decision tree for whether a product is classified as a therapeutic good has already been updated. (see image below)

---

#### Summary (in layman’s terms):

- For the most part, Sports Supplements are classified as “Foods” as per Food Standards Australian and New Zealand. To be specific “Formulated Supplementary Sports Foods”.
- The TGA believes that some of these supplements should be classified as “therapeutics goods” due to claims and/or ingredients and form (capsules & tablets).

---

#### Who/what will this affect the most?

- Any supplements that contain WADA or ASADA non-compliant ingredients.
- All Australian manufacturers.
- All products that make therapeutic claims.
- Changes are to be put before parliament circa May 2020.

---

#### Why is this change required (as put forward by the TGA)?

- The TGA believes that for the greater good of the population, there needs to be greater regulation, in relation to the claims made by “formulated supplementary sports foods”.
- Extreme examples provided by TGA.

---

#### Myth busters:

- “All claims” will classify products as therapeutic = MYTH.
- Any Caffeine product with high levels of caffeine will be classified as therapeutic = MYTH.

---

#### Questions that were not answered or still to be answered:

- Various questions regarding the implications and enforcement of the proposed changes.

---

#### How will this affect VPA® products?

- As it stands, the proposed TGA changes will not affect VPA® products in their current formulations.
- Capsules and tablets will be assessed on a line by line basis to assess the ROI that they provide in relation to the registration costs.

---

#### Why are all tablets/capsules/pills classified as therapeutic?

- The TGA proposes that the “man on the bondi tram” believes that something in capsule form is medicinal in nature. VPA® agrees somewhat or more accurately doesn’t have a counter argument/study to propose otherwise.
