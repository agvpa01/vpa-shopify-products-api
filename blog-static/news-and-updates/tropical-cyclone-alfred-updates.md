### Update: March 10, 2025

#### Update on Cyclone Alfred & Our Operations

As reported, **Cyclone Alfred** was downgraded to a tropical low by the time it reached the mainland off Southeast Queensland on **Saturday afternoon**.

Our **hearts go out to everyone affected** by the heavy rain, strong winds, fallen trees, property damage, and tragic loss of life—especially in **Lismore** and the **ADF truck accident** that has been reported. We extend our deepest support to those impacted and to the incredible individuals working tirelessly on the clean-up efforts.

#### VPA Operations & Expected Delays

As of **Monday, 10th March**, our production and customer service teams are operating as usual.

- We are awaiting confirmation from Australia Post and ARAMEX regarding courier pickups from our Brisbane warehouse. If courier services remain disrupted, **all orders will be dispatched from our Melbourne warehouse** to minimize delays. However, due to ongoing recovery efforts, **we anticipate shipping delays of 3 to 5 days** for Brisbane-based orders.
- **Australia Post has declared a Force Majeure Event in Queensland and NSW**, meaning that all **Express Post items will not be eligible for next-day delivery**. We appreciate our customers' understanding as logistics networks recover.

#### What You Can Do

While we are dispatching orders as quickly as possible, Australia Post and couriers are prioritizing critical deliveries, including medical and essential supplies. As a result, we ask for patience as deliveries may take longer than usual.

During this time, please be mindful and respectful to courier drivers, who will be under immense pressure managing the high volume of deliveries. Their efforts are crucial in helping communities recover from this event, and your kindness goes a long way.

We truly appreciate your support and understanding. Our thoughts remain with everyone affected, and we will continue to provide updates as the situation evolves.

### March 5, 2025

At VPA, the safety and well-being of our customers, staff, and community remain our top priority. With Cyclone Alfred expected to bring severe weather conditions across the Brisbane region from Thursday through the weekend, we are taking proactive measures to ensure minimal disruption while keeping our team safe.

#### Brisbane Warehouse Closure & Order Dispatch

**Our Brisbane warehouse will be closed on Thursday and Friday, 6-7 March, 2025.**

- All orders will be dispatched from our Melbourne facility during this period to maintain order fulfillment.
- Customer service will remain operational remotely to assist with any queries.
- You may track your orders online through [Australia Post](https://auspost.com.au/mypost/track/) and [Aramex](https://www.aramex.com/us/en/track/shipments) as couriers will continue to operate outside of affected regional centers, though delays in Queensland and New South Wales are expected due to road closures and severe weather impacts.

We appreciate your patience and understanding as we navigate these challenges.

#### Expected Delivery Delays

- **Brisbane Dispatch:** Due to cyclone recovery efforts, including road closures and potential flash flooding, delivery times may be significantly affected. Delays could range from a few days to several weeks, depending on post-cyclone conditions.
- **Interstate & Regional Orders:** Orders dispatched from Melbourne will proceed as usual, but minor delays may still occur due to disruptions in logistics.

We encourage all customers to plan ahead where possible and monitor updates for any further changes.

#### Cyclone Safety & Warehouse Precautions

We have taken all necessary safety measures to protect our team and facilities:

- Comprehensive cyclone safety briefings have been conducted with staff.
- Our Brisbane warehouse has been fully secured, with all external movable objects removed.
- Remote work arrangements have been implemented for staff during the cyclone period.

#### Dolphins Game Ticket Update

Due to the impact of Cyclone Alfred, the scheduled Dolphins game at Suncorp Stadium on Friday night has been relocated to Sydney. Unfortunately, this means that our planned allocation of Dolphins tickets will no longer proceed. We apologize for any inconvenience and appreciate your understanding.
