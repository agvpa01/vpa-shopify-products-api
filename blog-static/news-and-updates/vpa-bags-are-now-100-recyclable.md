### Scoops

VPA is currently in the process of removing scoops from some of our single ingredient supps in a bid to reduce our plastic usage. However, some products will still have the classic green VPA scoop. These scoops are made of PP (Polypropylene) which is also used to make ice cream and yoghurt containers. These can be recycled using your kerbside recycling bin. Same goes for our small white scoops.

### Supps Bottles

If you’ve tried one of our blended supplements such as BCAAs, pre-workout, collagen, multigreens, protein ball mix, ZMA6 etc, you would have come across our white bottles. These are made up of a combination of PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate), which can be found in soft drink and juice bottles, and PP. These white bottles can also be recycled using your kerbside recycling bin, just make sure they’re empty.

Alternatively, remove the label and reuse your bottles to store pantry ingredients, bulk wholefoods or washing powder.

### Shakers

We’re not sure why you’d be throwing out your plastic VPA shaker but hypothetically let’s say you were, it’s made of PP so pop it in your recycling bin.

### Protein Bags

Protein bags are a bit trickier than the rest. They are made up of a combination of PP, PET and LDPE (Low-Density Polyethylene). As mentioned, PP and PET can be recycled however LDPE, which you’ll know from plastic shopping bags, bin liners and zip-lock bags, can’t be recycled at home.

Prior to Nov 2022 these soft flexible plastics were recycled into furniture, fencing and road-based infrastructure through a program called REDcycle, however this has temporarily been paused. New solutions are currently being investigated (e.g. Curby) but for now soft plastics go in with the regular rubbish.

Alternatively, wash and dry out your protein bag and reuse it for frozen fruit and veg, or to store dry pantry items.

At VPA we want to support our planet’s future so join us and dispose of your packaging thoughtfully by reusing or recycling it.
