### VPA® Australia changed names for legal reasons

Unfortunately from time to time, mis-information is sometimes a part of business. In light of this we have created this page to bust any myths in relation to the VPA® Australia brand.

If you would like clarification to anything in relation to the VPA® Australia brand, please feel free to fill out this [form](https://vpa.fit/anti-competitive-behaviour) or call us on 1300 669 264. We have a team of customer service staff (M-F 9am-4.30pm) that are more than willing to answer your queries and quash any misinformation that you may have received. For legal clarification we may also request the source of said information.

### VPA® Australia’s prices are lower because they use cheaper ingredients.

Absolutely not. Our name change in 2016 was due to the fact that we were unable to trademark the “Venom” brand in Asia (translates into “poison”, which was deemed against the peace). There was absolutely no change in ownership or malicious reason for our name change. We are now proud to say that VPA® Australia is a registered trademark in 44 countries around the world. See the map below for a full list of countries.

### VPA® Australia was previously owned by Redbak Australia

We have absolutely no affiliation or connection to the Redbak brand in Australia and never have.

Yours in health and fitness,  
VPA Australia
