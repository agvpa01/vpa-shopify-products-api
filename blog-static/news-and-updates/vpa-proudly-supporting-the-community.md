### Bushfire Appeal

Early this year, Australia faced one of the most devastating bushfire crises. As the world came together to help in this time of need, the VPA® Australia team had also organised a fund-raiser to raise funds for our firefighters and communities directly impacted by the widespread and devastating bushfires. VPA® had matched donations dollar for dollar. And together with your generosity, our community was able to raise $1567 and VPA® has donated $10,000.

We have given the funds to [The Rural Fire Service (RFS)](https://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/) and [The Salvation Army](https://www.salvationarmy.org.au/).

### Clean Up Australia Day

The VPA® team is strongly committed to reducing plastic waste as well as promoting the [recycling of our VPA® bags](/blogs/news-and-updates/vpa-bags-are-now-100-recyclable) by partnering up with REDcycle last year to make a positive difference in the community and our environment.

This year, our team organized a beach clean up at the Redcliffe Beach to which we found an incredible amount of plastics.

### Mater Hospital Foundations

VPA® Australia is a proud supporter of the Mater Little Miracles Foundation. Having had children in the Mater Private Hospital, our staff know the amazing work that the nurses, support staff, surgeons, nursery workers and researchers within this organisation do for mothers and families.

Families are flown in from all around Queensland and Northern NSW for bubs that require intensive care in the first weeks and months of life. The staff have amazing empathy and care for each of their patients.
