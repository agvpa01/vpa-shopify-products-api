---

Glenn Azar is a successful entrepreneur, former Soldier, Kickboxer, Boxer, Personal Trainer, Registered Nurse, Professional Boxing Trainer, Success coach, he has started and sold multiple successful businesses. His Daughter is the youngest Australian to summit Mt Everest at 17 years old, and again at 19 years old, she also did the Kokoda track when she was only 8.

Glen himself has done the Kokoda track 70 times for a total of 6,720Km. Currently, Glenn and his Daughter run Adventure professionals, a world-class provider of incredible outdoor adventures including Everest Base Camp, Kilimanjaro, Kokoda, dog sledding under the northern lights and more.

Their team of expert leaders, guides, medics and local support networks will ensure unforgettable experience, allowing people to push through their physical and mental barriers to turn ‘bucket list’ ‘one days’ and ‘I wish I could’s’ into ‘reality’, ‘today’ and ‘wow I did it’. But as you will hear, Glenn did not have a great start in life and his ability to turn obstacles and negative experiences into success are truly inspiring. So sit back and enjoy as I chat with Glenn Azar.
