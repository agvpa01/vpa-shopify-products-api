Almost every triathlete is looking for the next strategy they can use to get an edge for a competition or to improve their performance. And while supplements certainly are not the laying foundation for great performance, optimizing your supplement routine can help take your performance to the next level.

## Caffeine

Caffeine is [well-known to be a performance booster](https://idealnutrition.com.au/the-low-down-on-caffeine-and-sports-performance/) for endurance events. The biggest benefit that people notice is that it reduces the rate of perceived effort. It makes things feel easier.

But more importantly, it can improve your record times. A meta-analysis that included the majority of the research on caffeine and endurance performance highlighted that it [improved performance by an average of 2.2%](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29876876/).

Reducing your triathlon time by 1-3% is a pretty big deal for something as simple as consuming caffeine, and most people are willing to put in a lot more work for fewer results.

From another perspective, caffeine is a gastrointestinal stimulant. This is not relevant for everybody. But if it causes any gastrointestinal distress that noticeably impacts your performance, it is worthwhile weighing up the pros and cons. If that gastrointestinal distress impacts your performance negatively, it could outweigh the 1-3% boost caffeine provides.

Dosage: 1-3mg/kg of body weight, 30 minutes before the race. Going up to as high as 6mg/kg can be an option as well.

## Beetroot Juice

One of the more recent supplements that have burst onto the radar of triathletes looking to improve their performance is [beetroot juice](https://idealnutrition.com.au/beetroot-juice-endurance/). The way beetroot juice works is through the effects of nitrates.

Nitrates are typically found in vegetables and they mainly act by vasodilation and improved blood flow. This results in increased efficiency and [improved time to exhaustion](http://sshs.exeter.ac.uk/news/research/title_37371_en.html).

In terms of performance, this improved blood flow translates to an [average reduction in race times of around the 1.5% mark](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5295087/).

Dosage: 5-7mmol of nitrate around 3hrs before training.

The effects typically take 30 minutes to be noticeable, [peak after 90 minutes, and last for 6-8hrs](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/hypertensionaha.107.103523?ijkey=5ec725973d624beded6be2d3792e3ed9a10b09d2).

It is also worth noting that [taking beetroot juice daily for 3-4 days improves its effectiveness](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpregu.00206.2010) even more than acute dosage, so arguably it would make sense to do that instead of just a once-off dose. The effects seem to plateau after about 6 days.

The final thing to be aware of is that you must not brush your teeth or use mouthwash right after taking beetroot juice as it can block the conversion of nitrates into nitrites, which also blocks the effectiveness of the supplement.
