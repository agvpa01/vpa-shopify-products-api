### What is the keto diet?

The keto eating strategy was first discovered by Dr. Russel Wilder in France as a treatment for Epilepsy patients. They found that a common side effect for this eating strategy was weight loss. A keto diet involves an individual ingesting less than 20 grams of net carbohydrates a day. A net carbohydrate is one that is absorbed by the body. You calculate this by subtracting the fiber from the total number of carbohydrates.

A keto diet needs to be high in fat, sufficient in protein and low in carbohydrates. By restricting the amount of carbohydrates consumed, the body changes the way it produces and uses energy. Insulin levels decrease and fat stores are converted into fatty acids. Fatty acids are transported to the liver where they are oxidized, turned into ketones and used as energy. Having a high number of ketones in the blood is termed a metabolic state of ketosis. Intermittent fasting is a strategy often used to help reach and sustain ketosis.

### Supplements to take on a keto diet

Here is a list of 4 VPA® supplements you can take on a keto diet.

#### VPA® Venom® Pre Workout

For that extra bit of boost for your next workout session, you cannot go past [VPA® Venom® Pre Workout](/products/kleos-pre-workout). At only 0.8g of carbs in every serve, and less than 0.1g of sugar, this pre-workout will help you stay well under 20g of net carbs a day. The caffeine will keep you energised and the taste will keep you intrigued.

Unlike a lot of other pre-workouts on the market, Venom® Pre-workout does not contain any refined sugars. Venom® is sweetened with Thaumatin which is a Katemfe Fruit extract. This natural sweetener has a ranking of 0 on the glycemic index so it is keto friendly. Venom® also contains Ashwagandha extract. Ashwaganda regulates cortisol (commonly known as the “stress hormone”) levels which can potentially hinder muscle growth and recovery.

#### VPA® Whey Protein Isolate
