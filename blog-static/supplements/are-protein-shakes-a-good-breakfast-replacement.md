## What is a protein shake?

Protein powders and shakes are available in many different forms. There are pure protein powder products such as [whey protein isolate](/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder) and [whey protein concentrate](/products/premium-whey-wpc) which provide the maximum amount of protein per serve. There are also pure plant based proteins such as pea, rice soy, or our [Premium Plant certified vegan protein](/products/premium-plant-vegan-protein). Protein powder blends combine protein with other ingredients to produce a more nutritionally complete powders. Examples of VPA blended protein products include [Lean Shake Plus](/products/lean-shake-plus-meal-replacement), [Breakfast Shake](/products/breakfast-shake), and [Muscle Gainer](/products/muscle-gainer).

## What is the best breakfast?

Egg breakfast

One thing I hope we can all agree on, is that that breakfast cereals are not the ideal breakfast food. Low in calories, fat and protein, breakfast cereals are often made of high GI processed grains and do not provide enough energy or nutrients to get you through to lunch time. The best breakfasts are higher in energy, and contain a good balance of macronutrients including protein and fat. This is what makes eggs an ideal breakfast food. However, eggs and other nutritionally complete meals require cooking and preparation, and for time poor people this is not a feasible, especially during the working week.

## Are protein shakes a good breakfast replacement?

Eating fresh and nutritionally balanced meals is always a superior option, but for those that are time poor a protein shake for breakfast is an excellent option. For these people, a shake might be the difference between a poor or excellent recovery after a morning workout. Breakfast could mean the difference between concentrating on the job or performing well in an exam, or not.

## What makes a good breakfast shake?

Like any breakfast meal, a [breakfast protein shake](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/recipes/breakfast-vanilla-milk-shake?_pos=5&_sid=5b659ff44&_ss=r) should be nutritionally complete. It should have all of the three macronutrients to sustain you through to lunch time, and keep you feeling satisfied. A breakfast protein shake should have:

- **Protein:** To keep you feeling full and provide amino acids to build and repair muscles and other vital compounds within our body.
- **Carbohydrate:** Preferable low GI, to provide you energy through to lunch time.
- **Fat:** Essential to health and also plays a role in reducing hunger.
- **Fibre:** For digestive health and to aid in hunger control.

Pure protein powders like WPI and WPC do not provide all of these macronutrients as they are almost pure whey protein. For this reason, having a pure protein shake made on water is not the ideal breakfast shake. Some people mix their whey protein with milk. This is one way to add additional energy, carbohydrate and fat to make it more nutritionally complete. Those with a bit more time, will blend pure protein powder with additional ingredients such as oats, yogurt, fruit, and vegetables to create a complete meal. But again, this is not always an option for time poor people.

If you want a complete breakfast shake, but just don’t have the time to make one, we’ve got you covered. [VPA® Breakfast Shake](/products/breakfast-shake) is perhaps the most underrated of all of our products. Let us explain why it is the best choice if you are looking for a protein shake for breakfast.

One 70g serve of breakfast shake provides you with 266 calories, 31g of protein, 22g of carbohydrate, 5 grams of fat and 5 grams of fibre.

Due to all the additional ingredients, Breakfast Shake has quite a different texture to pure protein powders. Most people describe it as being slightly thicker and grittier but this nutritionally complete breakfast shake will keep you feeling full for hours.
