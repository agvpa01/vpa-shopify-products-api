### Whey Protein Isolate or Whey Protein Concentrate

Anyone remember newbie gains? I do, fondly. That period of time when you first start strength training when gains seem to come quickly and easily as a result of simply turning up to the gym. But alas, the newbie gain train eventually comes to an end, and we are faced with putting hard and consistent work over a long period of time to add kilos to our lifts. I’m not even going to tell you the embarrassing amount of time it’s taken me to add a measly 2.5kg to my benchpress. (As a side note, have you ever noticed how many people quit strength sports when newbie gains end?) Other than smart programming, progressive overload, good nutrition and rest and recovery, there are three supplements that all serious strength athletes should be taking.

Both **[WPI](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder)** and **[WPC](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/premium-whey-wpc)** are proteins derived from cows milk. They differ only in the number of times they have been filtered, with the extra filtering of WPI resulting in a higher protein, lower carbohydrate and fat protein powder than WPC. WPI and WPC provide the amino acid building blocks we need to build more muscle. Whey protein contains all 9 essential amino acids, including high levels of the amino acid leucine, which has been shown to effectively trigger and stimulate muscle protein synthesis.

A daily dose of at least 1.6g of protein per kg of body weight a day is optimal for increasing muscle size and strength. If possible, protein intake should be timed around training. As far as high quality, and convenience options WPI and WPC are ideal protein sources to help strength athletes progress in their training.
