### How do I know if I’m getting enough protein?

Nutrition guidelines suggest an intake of 1g of protein per kg of body weight per day. This is half of what I recommend as a performance dietitian for women chasing strength gains or hypertrophy. Protein intake is even more important if you are a woman who identifies as being part of one or more of these groups or are:

- Following a plant-based diet
- Under-eating or under-fuelling
- Eliminating food groups
- If you are peri- or post-menopausal

Women in these groups have higher protein needs, and need rapid intake of protein post-training to mitigate muscle loss and help with brain fog.

### How can BCAAs help women?

Supplementing with BCAAs could be a game-changer if you identify with one or more of the above groups. BCAAs are a cluster of three essential amino acids. The most important of these is leucine as it is the precursor to muscle protein synthesis. For women, the main benefit of BCAA lies in its intracellular signalling pathway involved in protein synthesis and it’s ability to counter central nervous system fatigue.

### How much BCAA do I need and when should I take it?

I recommend a standard dose of 5-7g of BCAAs under the following conditions:

- Before strength training in the morning if you are unable to have a high protein breakfast first.
- Women doing fasted cardio – no woman should train fasted!
- Peri- or Post- menopausal women before strength training. Whether you are a novice lifter or national record holder, BCAAs would benefit you.
- Female athletes on restrictive energy budgets who are in the late stages of elite contest preparation.

### What BCAA supplement should I take?

My preference is unflavoured BCAAs. VPA® offers [BCAA 2:1:1](/products/bcaa-2-1-1) in 200g. They also offer [BCAA 7000](/products/bcaa-7000) in 300g tubs as well as [sample packs](/products/bcaa-7000-sample-pack-5-flavours-10-samples) to try all 5 flavours. Check them out below.
