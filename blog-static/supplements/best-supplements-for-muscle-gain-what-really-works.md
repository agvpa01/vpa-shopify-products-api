## Introduction

Gym goers enter their fitness journey to gain strength and build those “big guns.” Simply put, they want to gain muscle that helps them build an attractive body and gain adequate strength that takes them through old age without much pain. Building muscle, or muscle gain, requires much more than lifting those heavy barbells; it requires proper nutrition, optimal rest, and the right nutrient supplementation. Sometimes, our diets may not be adequate for all the essential nutrients needed to build muscle. This is where muscle-building supplements come into the picture.

With the market flooded with muscle-gain supplements, it can be challenging to determine which ones truly work. Not having the correct knowledge can often lead to incorrect supplementation and potentially harmful side effects.

So, we present a comprehensive guide for the best supplements for muscle gain, explaining how they function and why they should be part of your regimen.

## 9 Best Muscle-Building Supplements

Combining a solid diet with the right supplements can optimize your progress for effective muscle growth. Here are some of the best muscle-building supplements:

### 1. Whey Protein Isolate (WPI) and Whey Protein Concentrate (WPC)

Whey protein is a high-quality protein obtained from milk during cheese-making. Whey protein comes in different forms, each with unique benefits.

#### Whey Protein Isolate (WPI)

[Whey Protein Isolate (WPI)](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder) is processed heavily to remove most fats and lactose, leaving a residue that is 90% protein. It is an excellent source of protein for individuals looking for a leaner protein source and using whey protein for weight loss. WPI is often recommended due to its high protein content and lower carbohydrate and fat levels.

#### Whey Protein Concentrate (WPC)

[Whey Protein Concentrate (WPC)](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/premium-whey-wpc) contains 70-80% protein, with some lactose and fats. It is a natural and economical form of whey protein. WPC provides a balanced source of essential nutrients and is suitable for those who want a natural protein boost while retaining key health benefits.

### 2. Creatine Monohydrate

Creatine monohydrate powder increases the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the body’s primary energy source. This improves strength, power, and endurance, making it a staple ingredient in many pre-workout supplements. Creatine monohydrate powder also increases muscle size.

Creatine is one of the most effective supplements for improving athletic performance (e.g., how many sprints you can do at a time). It enhances muscle hydration, giving your muscles a more prominent look and allowing for greater endurance and faster recovery. The recommended dose for optimal results is 20 grams of creatine in the initial five days, followed by 3-5 grams daily thereafter.

### 3. Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs)

Branched-chain amino Acids, or BCAAs, are another common ingredient in pre-workout supplements. These essential amino acids preserve muscle tissue, reduce muscle soreness, and aid recovery, especially during prolonged or intense exercise sessions. Most pre-workouts contain 400-1500 mg of BCAAs.

### 4. Beta-Alanine

Beta-alanine is a non-essential amino acid that buffers muscle lactic acid production, prolonging high-intensity exercise by delaying fatigue. It is known for the tingling sensation (paresthesia) it causes, which is a harmless side effect.

Beta-Alanine is particularly beneficial for those in strength and high-intensity interval training (HIIT). Research suggests that supplementing with 5-6 grams per day, taken in intervals like 2 grams each with breakfast, lunch, and supper, can significantly improve performance by increasing muscle carnosine levels, which act as a buffer against acid accumulation in muscles. Beta-alanine levels are found to rise and fall within two hours of consumption; hence, supplementing at intervals is crucial. Some people may experience a tingling sensation; therefore, careful supplementation is the key.

### 5. L-Citrulline

[Citrulline Malate](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/citrulline-malate), or L-citrulline, is an amino acid found in watermelon. It enhances nitric oxide production, improving blood flow and oxygen delivery to muscles. It also reduces muscle soreness, improves aerobic energy production, and delays muscle fatigue, making it one of the best pre-workout ingredients for performance.

Doses between 3 and 5 grams are necessary for active people, and 6 to 8 grams are most effective for enhancing athletic performance.

### 6. Caffeine

Caffeine is found in many [high-stim pre-workout powders](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/venom-pre-workout). It wakes your body up, boosts energy levels, reduces fatigue, and increases endurance by blocking adenosine receptors in the brain. The amount of caffeine in [pre-workout supplements](https://www.vpa.com.au/collections/pre-workout-supplements) varies, with high-stim formulas containing larger doses to provide intense energy.

Even studies prove caffeine significantly improves exercise performance, particularly in endurance sports and high-intensity training (HIIT). The typical caffeine dosage in pre-workouts ranges from 150mg to 300mg per serving, equalling almost three cups of coffee, which is a lot if you are sensitive to caffeine. Hence, lower doses are always recommended to assess tolerance.

### 7. Glutamine

Glutamine is a non-essential amino acid, meaning the body produces it independently. However, during periods of intense exercise, glutamine levels might be depleted. Therefore, most bodybuilders take 5-10 grams of glutamine per day. Glutamine aids muscle recovery, promotes muscle growth, and improves gut health and nutrient absorption.

### 8. Casein

Casein is another form of milk-based protein. Cow milk contains two types of proteins — casein and whey– comprising 80% and 20% of its protein content, respectively. Both casein and whey are protein-rich, containing all essential amino acids, meaning they’re complete proteins. Although both are dairy-based byproducts of cheese production, they produce different results on a molecular level.

During the cheesemaking process, skim milk is treated with special enzymes or acids, causing the casein in the milk to coagulate. This coagulated part of the milk is called casein, and it can be used to make [micellar casein protein powder](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/micellar-casein) and other dairy products. The leftover liquid in this process is whey protein, which is dried and powdered to create protein supplements.

### 9. High Stim Pre-Workout Powder

For those who require a significant energy boost, high-stim pre-workouts contain stimulants such as caffeine, theobromine, or synephrine. These supplements offer a sharper, more immediate boost of energy and focus. They are the best pre-workout for individuals with a high caffeine tolerance or those engaging in intense workouts, thus helping them gain more muscle.

We’ll delve more into the details of these supplements in further sections.

## Understanding Muscle Growth

Muscle growth, or muscle hypertrophy, is not a simple feat. It is an output achieved through resistance training, proper nutrition, and recovery. Here are the key factors that contribute to muscle growth:

- **Progressive Overload**: Weight, strength, and resistance training are the keys to muscle gain. However, lifting weights isn’t enough. Actual muscle growth happens by increasing resistance over time through heavier weights or higher repetitions that continually challenge muscles.
- **Adequate Protein Intake**: Protein is the building block of muscle. Research shows that the human body needs 0.5-0.8 grams of protein per pound of body weight to increase muscle mass when working out. Protein provides the essential amino acids to repair and build muscle tissue.
- **Rest and Recovery**: Allowing muscles time to recover is crucial for optimal muscle growth.
- **Proper Supplementation**: Using scientifically-backed best supplements for muscle gain enhances performance and recovery.

Besides the above factors, genetics and body type also influence how fast a person can build muscle. Males and females have the following body types: mesomorphic (more muscular and builds muscle mass more quickly), ectomorphic (a slim or straight frame that builds muscle less quickly but can increase strength through resistance training), and endomorphic (a rounded or curvy body that builds muscle through strength training).

However, regardless of body type, everyone needs essential supplements for muscle gain and strength. These muscle-gain supplements hasten muscle growth and improve endurance and recovery.
