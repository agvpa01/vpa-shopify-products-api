### What is collagen?

Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body and is responsible for providing structure and strength to our connective tissues. Connective tissues include tendons, ligaments, bones, and cartilage. Most sports people will at some point experience injury to these tissues. Connective tissues heal very slowly in comparison to other tissues. This can cause frustration and subsequent re-injury if you return to high training loads without adequate rehab or healing time. This blog will discuss the evidence for collagen supplementation for tendon repair.

### What does the evidence say about collagen supplementation for tendon repair?

Taking 15g collagen with around 48mg of Vitamin C, 30-60mins prior to targeted training such as jumping, [doubles collagen production](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5183725/) after those sessions, when compared to a placebo. This is great evidence for the effectiveness of collagen supplementation for tendon repair. 15g of collagen is around one serve of [VPA® Collagen Pro®](/products/collagen-pro-r).

Collagen intake improves function, instability, and pain perception in ligament and joint damage. Crucially, the studies that produced positive results combined supplementation with targeted tendon/joint exercises or resistance training. The theory is that the additional availability of the key amino acids required for collagen production allows the tissues to strengthen in the direction and for the purpose of the targeted activity. So, taking collagen supplements without complementary exercises is unlikely to have any effect on injury healing or the prevention of injury.
