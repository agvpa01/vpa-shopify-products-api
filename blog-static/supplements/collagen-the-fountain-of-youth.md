### Collagen is the Body’s Scaffolding

Collagen is often referred to as the body’s scaffolding, as it is the protein that glues the body together and one of the most abundant proteins found in the human body.

### So What is Collagen?

Collagen is the most abundant source of protein in our body and is made up of long chains of linked amino acids. Collagen are the building blocks of our connective tissue, which is essential to the function of our muscles, tendons, ligaments, bones, skin, blood vessels and digestive system.

Unfortunately, the production of our natural collagen begins to decline in our mid-twenties at a rate of 1.5% per year, but by consuming collagen you can combat this decline. Our dietary source of quality collagen comes from parts of the animals that aren’t popular in today’s diet. Traditional diets that would use the whole animal were rich in collagen, whereas modern diets lack this collagen and need help from a quality supplement. So unless you wanting to boil bones to create bone broth every day, you may need a quality collagen supplement. But not all collagen supplements are made the same, you need to be careful.

You need to be sure that you find a collagen supplement that is in a format that our body can easily access and use. Hydrolyzed collagen is what you need, which simply means that it contains a smaller molecular structure making it easier for the collagen peptides to enter your bloodstream and be transported to the area your body most needs it.
