# Gym enthusiasts, fitness freaks, and health-conscious individuals swear by this one supplement – creatine monohydrate.

Creatine is indeed the body's powerhouse. It fuels the body by inducing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production—the body’s energy engine. While creatine monohydrate is a well-researched supplement, with its benefits well-rooted in scientific evidence, its close kin, creatine HCL, is still finding its footing. Are these two different?

Here is a look at creatine HCL vs monohydrate, what to choose, and how to consume the supplement for optimal results.

## What Is Creatine?

Creatine occurs naturally in the body in muscle cells. Some natural sources of creatine include red meat and seafood. It primarily aids in producing ATP, which fuels muscle contractions and supplies energy to the body. Creatine is synthesized mainly in the liver, kidneys, and pancreas using the amino acids arginine, glycine, and methionine. The body stores approximately 95% of its creatine in skeletal muscles, with the remaining 5% distributed across the brain, cardiac muscle, and testicles.

Since creatine is proven to enhance athletic performance, support muscle recovery, and increase strength, creatine is also available as a dietary supplement. [Creatine monohydrate](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/creatine-monohydrate) is available and widely used by athletes, bodybuilders, and fitness enthusiasts across different sports.

However, closely following suit is creatine HCL – what you may call the “Gen-Z” of creatine. Let’s get a basic understanding of creatine HCL vs monohydrate.

As the name suggests, creatine HCL is creatine hydrochloride–creatine molecularly bound with hydrochloric acid to enhance solubility and absorption. It absorbs quickly into the bloodstream and is 30-40 times more soluble in water than creatine monohydrate, negating the adverse side effects of creatine monohydrate, such as indigestion and excess water retention.

## How Creatine Works

Creatine is stored in the muscles as phosphocreatine, which acts as your body’s energy reservoir. When you engage in intense, short-interval activities, such as sprinting or weightlifting, your muscles rely on ATP for immediate energy. However, ATP depletes rapidly and must be restored from time to time. This is where creatine steps in – it helps regenerate ATP, enabling sustained power output and performance.

Creatine pulls water into your muscles, giving your muscles that pumped look you have always dreamed of. Moreover, it reduces soreness and allows faster muscle recovery so that you can hit the gym again with the same energy.

Moreover, cognitive function improves as the brain stores some of the creatine reserves, aiding better sleep.

## Why Supplement with Creatine?

To summarize in a few words, creatine helps with the following:

- Increases muscle mass and strength by boosting ATP production.
- Enhances workout performance and athletic endurance by reducing fatigue.
- Speeds up muscle recovery by reducing muscle cell damage and inflammation.
- Supports brain health by aiding cognitive function, promoting restful sleep, and reducing mental fatigue.

Given its significant benefits, creatine is one of the most popular supplements among athletes, bodybuilders, and fitness enthusiasts.

This brings us to the question of how creatine monohydrate and creatine HCL compare. Let’s find out.

## Creatine Monohydrate vs HCL: Quick Side-by-Side Comparison

| Feature                              | Creatine Monohydrate        | Creatine HCL        |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| Absorption rate                      | Relatively slower           | Faster              |
| Research backing                     | Extensively-researched       | Little research     |
| Creatine HCL vs monohydrate dosage   | 3-5 g, loading-unloading may be done for higher muscle saturation | 1-2 g per day |
| Bloating Risk                        | Possible bloating in some users | Fewer bloating cases |
| Cost                                 | Easier on the pockets        | More expensive, though a lower dosage may make it more cost-friendly |
| Creatine HCL vs monohydrate for weight loss | Water retention can lead to temporary weight gain and puffiness | Minimization of side effects due to less bloating and water retention |
| Creatine HCL vs monohydrate for muscle growth | Very effective in muscle growth and hypertrophy | Limited studies suggest similar effectiveness with lower dosages |
