## A Creatine Cycle

A creatine cycle typically involves a loading phase of 20-25g daily for 5-7 days, followed by a maintenance phase of 3-5g daily. [Learn more](#).

## What is Creatine and what does it do?

Creatine is a natural source of energy that helps your skeletal muscles contract. It is crucial in producing energy in your muscles, especially during high-intensity exercise. Your body produces creatine naturally but supplementation can increase the body’s phosphocreatine stores, which improves performance in activities like weightlifting or sprinting.

Protein-rich foods like milk, red meat, seafood, and more also lead to more creatine supply for your body, ultimately improving muscle growth and enhancing recovery.

## Myth-Busting: Common Misconceptions About Creatine

Despite its various benefits, several myths have been surrounding the use and safety of creatine. Let’s debunk some of the most common misconceptions:

### Myth 1: Creatine is hard on the kidneys and liver.

There are no negative side effects of creatine use on your liver or kidneys. The scientific literature is full of studies showing creatine to be safe for both short-term and long-term use.

However, taking creatine might worsen kidney or liver disease in people who have already been diagnosed with such conditions. Therefore, those with pre-existing kidney or liver issues should consult with a healthcare professional before using creatine.

### Myth 2: You need to cycle so you don’t build a tolerance to it.

Your body doesn’t build up a tolerance to creatine. It is possible that you may no longer consciously register the boost it provides, but this is simply because you are now operating optimally at each session. Just because you don’t notice the impact of creatine supplementation doesn’t mean you aren’t benefiting. Any plateaus to hypertrophy or strength can more than likely be put down to training or a sad farewell to newbie gains.

### Myth 3: Cycling off creatine keeps your body’s natural production high

There are no scientific studies that suggest your body will stop producing creatine when an external creatine source is supplied for long periods of time. The system that uses creatine in your body is very adaptable and will take any creatine it can when required for explosive movement.

## Why Cycle Creatine?

So, if cycling isn't required for the safe and effective use of creatine, why do some people choose to cycle creatine? Some athletes prefer to reset their supplement regimen and give their bodies a break from long-term supplementation.

## Implementing a Creatine Cycle: How to Do It?

If you finally decide to cycle creatine, here’s how to go about it.

### Overview of a Creatine Cycle

When people talk about a creatine cycle they are referring to a three-phase cycle. First, there is a high-dose creatine loading phase, followed by a lower-dose maintenance phase, and finally a period of taking no creatine at all

### The Loading Phase

Creatine loading is the first phase of the creatine cycle. It refers to a short period of time where you take a high dose of creatine to achieve maximum creatine storage in your muscles as quickly as possible.

A standard creatine loading stage recommends that 0.3g of creatine per kilogram of body weight is consumed each day for 5-7 days. For example, if you weigh 70kg, this would be calculated as follows: 0.3 x 70 = 21g per day.

This load phase daily dose is usually split over 3 or 4 doses in a day. This helps ensure that no digestive discomfort is experienced during the creatine loading phase.

### The Maintenance Phase

After the creatine loading period is completed, we move on to the maintenance phase.

A standard maintenance phase recommends that 0.03g of creatine per kilogram of body weight is consumed every day. For example, if you weigh 70kg, this would be calculated as follows: 0.03 x 70 = 2.1g per day.

As daily supplementation does not cause side effects or negatively impact health (if one does not have any pre-existing health conditions), many people choose to round this up to a flat 5g of creatine per day. This can be taken at any time, as long as it is taken every day.

### The Time-off phase

The time-off phase lasts for 2-4 weeks and during this time, you stop taking supplements and give your body a break. This phase is optional, but people cycling creatine typically take a break to prevent bloating or gastrointestinal discomfort that may be caused by the creatine loading phase.

## Benefits of Creatine Cycling

While creatine cycling is not essential, it is reported to have some benefits, including:

1. Enhanced muscle strength and endurance: Usage of creatine supplements helps with building muscle and endurance. This results in improved performance during explosive activities.
2. Muscle recovery: Creatine has been shown to improve muscle recovery after high-intensity exercise, reducing muscle soreness and allowing you to get back to your workouts quickly.
3. Psychological reset from supplements: Some people might just want to take a break from taking extra supplements and give their body a reset.

## Potential Risks and Safety Considerations of Creatine Cycling

Creatine is generally safe for most people when taken at the recommended daily dose. Although side effects are rare, it’s important to know about them.

### Side effects

Creatine might alter your body’s stored water content, driving additional water to your muscle cells. Some people might experience dehydration as a result. However, the shift in cellular water content is very minor and will very rarely lead to dehydration.
