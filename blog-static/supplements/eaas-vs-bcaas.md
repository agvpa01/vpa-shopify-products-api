## What Are Amino Acids and Why Do You Need Them?

Amino acids are the building blocks of protein that are essential to help your body function properly. From repairing tissue and building muscle to producing enzymes and hormones, your body relies on proteins to carry out a wide range of tasks.

There are 20 different types of amino acids, nine of which are essential amino acids.

### Essential Amino Acids

**Essential amino acids (EAAs)** cannot be made by the body, meaning they must come from dietary sources. The nine essential amino acids– Histidine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Lysine, Methionine, Phenylalanine, Threonine, Tryptophan, and Valine– each play a crucial role in various bodily functions like muscle repair, serotonin production, tissue regeneration, collagen synthesis, hormone production, and more.

Therefore, it’s important to include protein-rich foods in your diet. Foods that contain all nine essential amino acids are called complete proteins. Beef, poultry, fish, eggs, soy, quinoa, and dairy are some examples of complete proteins. Foods that contain some, but not all, EAAs are considered incomplete proteins. Some examples of such foods include nuts, seeds, beans, and some grains.

The remaining eleven amino acids are produced by your body itself. These are called non-essential amino acids.

### Non- Essential Amino Acids

Non-essential amino acids are alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, proline, serine and tyrosine. Some of these, like arginine, cysteine, glutamine, and tyrosine, among others are considered conditional amino acids, i.e., they’re only essential during illness or stress.

## Breaking down the difference between BCAA and EAA

When it comes to amino acids for fitness, essential amino acids (EAAs) and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are both worth discussing. EAAs include all nine essential amino acids, while BCAAs focus on three specific EAAs– Leucine, Isoleucine, and Valine–that focus on muscle recovery and growth.

While all BCAAs are EAAs, the reverse is not true. BCAAs are metabolised in the muscles as opposed to other amino acids which are metabolised in the liver. This means that BCAAs promote muscle protein synthesis, and enhance post-workout recovery. In this regard, BCAAs are especially beneficial during intense exercise and other high-intensity activities. Let’s delve deeper into EAA vs BCAA.

## EAAs vs BCAAs 

|                   | Essential Amino Acids | Branched-Chain Amino Acids |
|-------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| Composition       | EAAs are a group of nine amino acids that the body cannot synthesise on its own and must be obtained from the diet or supplements. These nine amino acids are: Histidine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Lysine, Methionine, Phenylalanine, Threonine, Tryptophan, Valine. EAAs are essential for overall protein synthesis and various bodily functions. | BCAAs are a subgroup of EAAs and consist of three specific amino acids: Leucine, Isoleucine, Valine. These amino acids have a branched-chain structure, which gives them their name. BCAAs are also essential, meaning they cannot be produced by the body and must be obtained from the diet or supplements. |
| Function          | EAAs play a broad role in protein synthesis, enzyme production, immune function, neurotransmitter synthesis, and more. They are involved in a wide range of physiological processes and are essential for overall health. | BCAAs are primarily involved in muscle protein synthesis and energy production. They are particularly important for athletes and individuals engaged in intense physical activities. Leucine, in particular, is known to stimulate muscle protein synthesis. |
| Use in supplements | [EAA supplements](https://www.vpa.com.au/collections/amino-acids/products/essential-amino-acids) typically contain all nine essential amino acids, including the three BCAAs (leucine, isoleucine, and valine). These supplements are designed to provide a complete profile of essential amino acids to support various bodily functions. | [BCAA supplements](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/bcaa-2-1-1?variant=32044672221239) specifically focus on the three branched-chain amino acids: [leucine](https://www.vpa.com.au/collections/amino-acids/products/leucine), isoleucine, and valine. They are often used by athletes and bodybuilders to support muscle growth, reduce muscle soreness, and improve exercise performance. |
| Food Sources      | **Animal Proteins:** Meat (such as beef, chicken, pork, and lamb), Poultry (such as chicken and turkey), Fish (such as salmon, tuna, and trout), Eggs (particularly egg whites), Dairy products (such as milk, yoghurt, and cheese). **Plant-Based Sources:** Quinoa: A plant-based source that contains all nine essential amino acids, Soy and soy products: Tofu, tempeh, and edamame are good sources of EAAs, Legumes: Beans (e.g., black beans, kidney beans, and chickpeas) and lentils contain various essential amino acids, Nuts and seeds: Almonds, pumpkin seeds, and chia seeds are examples of nuts and seeds with EAAs, Grains: Some grain...
