### What is egg protein powder?

Whey, plant-based, collagen, and egg protein powder. Who knew that protein powders could be so diverse, and that choosing one could be so difficult? One of the most overlooked and undervalued protein powders is egg protein powder. Below we will explain what egg protein powder is, what the benefits of it are, and how it can be used.

### How do you make egg protein powder?

Egg protein powder (EWPP), is pasteurised, dried and powdered egg white protein. Egg white protein is also called albumen, and that’s why you might see egg white protein powder called albumen powder. With a high biological value, and containing vitamins and minerals EWPP is a great choice of protein powder for many people.

### What are the benefits of egg protein powder?

Egg protein powder has some benefits over fresh eggs and other types of protein powder. We will explain these benefits below and how they will help you reach your diet and body composition goals.

#### It is dairy and lactose free

Unlike whey protein which comes from cows milk, EWPP is both dairy protein and lactose free. This makes it an ideal protein choice if you have dairy allergies or lactose intolerance. It’s also a good choice if you are on a low FODMAP diet as it should not cause you digestive discomfort. Are you finding that you are not as tolerant of whey protein as you used to be? This is because as we age, we can produce less lactase which is the enzyme that digests lactose.

#### It is low in carbohydrate and fat

Compared to whole eggs, egg white powder is relatively higher in protein and and lower in fat and calories. One 30g serve of EWPP has 25g of protein, 0.5g of fat, and no carbohydrate. This makes it an ideal choice for those wanting a high protein supplement without the added calories and fat.

#### It has a high bioavailability

The bioavailability score of a protein takes into account how easily the protein is digested, whether it provides the full range of amino acids, and how the protein is used. Egg white protein has a biological value of 100 which is as good as it gets in terms of protein quality, digestibility and effectiveness. EWPP is a complete protein meaning it contains all 21 amino acids that humans need. This gives it an advantage over plant-based proteins which are usually lacking some amino acids.

#### It increases lean muscle mass

Egg white powder contains high level of the amino acid Arginine which is a precursor of nitric oxide to stimulate growth hormone. It also stimulates insulin secretion and this has an anabolic effects on muscle growth. Consuming EWPP is an effective way of stimulating muscle growth and repair and can accelerate the rate at which muscle is gained.

#### It improves muscle recovery

Egg white powder contains high amounts of Branched Chain Amino Acids (BCAA) and these are useful in supporting muscle recovery. Leucine in the BCAA promotes rapid muscle recovery from exercise via anabolic muscle building effects.

#### It is a moderate acting protein

Egg white powder is slower to digest than WPI, but faster than casein. This makes it a useful protein to include in meals to promote muscle growth, but also keep you feeling satisfied.

#### It is safe and shelf-stable

Fresh eggs sometimes carry pathogens such as salmonella which can cause food poisoning and make you sick. During manufacturing, the egg whites are pasteurised and this removes any pathogens that may have been present. In powdered form, EWPP does not need to be kept chilled to stay fresh like fresh eggs and egg whites do. This makes it a handy protein source to have on hand to whip up a high protein snack or meal.

### How do you use egg protein powder?

Egg protein powder is a natural, unflavoured product and is considered to have a harsh taste. EWPP tends to foam when mixed in water so most people don’t use it in a shake like whey protein. The most common uses of EWPP are for cooking and use in savory dishes such as omlettes and baking. EWPP is ideal to blend in with whole eggs to make a higher protein omelette, or to mix with water to make an egg white omelette. Use salt, pepper and spices to add flavour, and boost the nutritional value by adding vegetables and making a complete meal of it.
