## What is Whey Protein?

Physical exercise and athletic performance requires specific macronutrients, especially protein and carbohydrates to replenish glycogen stores and to provide enough protein to build and repair muscle (1). The ideal source of such proteins is through whole foods such as meats, eggs, seafood and other high protein foods. However, to ensure that our body is able to meet the amount of protein required, [high-quality whey protein](/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder) can be a good supplement.

This article will help you understand everything you need to know about whey protein and allow you to make an informed purchasing decision next time you are in the market for a protein powder.

## How Does Whey Protein Work?

Many people do not understand where whey protein comes from, or even what whey is. Well, whey is a by-product of cheese manufacturing. It is the liquid that is left over after the milk has been processed. Although there are many uses for whey, it is now most popular within sports supplementation because of its high protein content and fast digestion speed.

### 3 types of whey protein:

1. [Whey protein concentrate or WPC](/products/premium-whey-wpc). WPC is the slowest digesting of the three, and consists of approximately 29%-89% protein, with minimal, but slightly higher levels of carbohydrates and fats than the other two whey proteins. WPC also has more lactose, this is why those who have sensitivities to lactose often choose WPI as their protein source.

2. [Whey protein isolate or WPI](/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder). WPI is a very fast digesting whey protein and consists of at least 90% protein, with almost no carbohydrates or fats. WPI is also 99% lactose-free, making it the more popular of the whey proteins.

3. Whey protein hydrolysate or WPH. WPH is the least popular of the three whey proteins due to its bitter taste and higher price. Although it is the fastest digesting of the three, it is only fractionally faster than the WPI, making the WPI and WPC the commonly used protein supplements for physical exercise.
