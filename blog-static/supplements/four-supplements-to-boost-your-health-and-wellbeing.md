## 1. Collagen Pro®

Combining the highest quality collagen hydrolysate, with pre- and probiotics, our VPA® Collagen Pro® is ideal for those who want to maximise their gut health. Did you know that [70% of our immune system is found in our gut](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2515351)? In other words, a healthy gut means a strong immune system, and Collagen Pro® can help you achieve gut health in three ways.

- The amino acids that make up collagen protein are [directly utilised by the gut and help keep it healthy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28174772).
- Probiotics is a fancy word for healthy bacteria. Foods which contain probiotics include yogurt, pickles, kefir, and sauerkraut. Pro-biotics can also be taken in powdered form, including in Collagen Pro®. Probiotics help populate our digestive tract with good bacteria, and this helps keep our gut healthy and our immune system strong.
- Prebiotics are what the good bacteria feed on, helping to keep the community diverse and healthy. The fibre you eat in food is a prebiotic, but they can also be taken in supplement form, such as the inulin which is included in Collagen Pro®.

Collagen also offers numerous benefits for joints, bones, tendons, ligaments, and cartilage because it is one of the main components of the various connective tissue in our body. You could say that collagen is the glue that holds the body together. Check them out by clicking on the photo above or add them to your cart in the button below.
