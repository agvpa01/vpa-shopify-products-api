### Do I need to use a protein supplement?

It’s entirely possible to hit your daily protein requirements using food alone. However, here are some reasons supplementing with protein may be beneficial and help you reach your daily protein goals:

Whether you have large protein requirements because you’re a heavy strength training man, or you’re requirements aren’t that high but you find it difficult to plan your food to hit your targets, a protein shake may help get you there.

#### Whey protein stimulates muscle synthesis

Due to its high leucine content, whey protein consistently outperforms other protein sources when it comes to stimulating muscle synthesis for repair and growth.

#### It's convenient

With the convenience and portability of a protein shake, there are literally no excuses for not being able to hit daily protein targets.
