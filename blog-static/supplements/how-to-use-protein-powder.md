## Why Use Protein Powder in the First Place?

Many first-time gym goers, fitness amateurs, or those new to healthy diet and nutrition have this misconception – protein powder makes you bulk up. But protein powder benefits are plenty.

According to the [recommended dietary allowance (RDA)](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/fo/c5fo01530h) 1 of protein for a healthy adult, the protein intake requirements are 0.8g of protein per kg body weight per day. To meet functional needs, such as skeletal muscle protein accretion and physical strength, a dietary intake of 1.0, 1.3, and 1.6 g of protein per kg of body weight per day is recommended for individuals with minimal, moderate, and intense physical activity, respectively.

Here are a few reasons why people, from gym-goers to busy professionals, include it in their diets:
- Supports muscle recovery after exercise by helping repair muscle tissue
- Helps maintain or build lean muscle mass, especially in calorie deficits or for those who exercise intensely
- Can curb hunger and support weight management goals
- Convenient and quick source of high-quality protein

## Who is it for?

- Beginners who struggle to meet daily protein targets
- Athletes or regular gym-goers need a higher protein intake
- People with busy lifestyles or limited access to protein-rich meals
- People who have a chronic health condition that requires more protein
- People who are older than 40 years, healing from wounds, or trying to gain weight.

To this effect, VPA Australia offers a range of options tailored to every goal: [WPC Protein](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/premium-whey-wpc), Whey Protein Isolate, [Vegan Protein](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/premium-plant-vegan-protein), and [Casein Protein](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/micellar-casein).

## When Should You Take Protein Powder?

Understanding how to take protein powder for beginners helps maximise the effects. It surely depends on your routine. Here are the most common timings:

### After Your Workout (Most Common)

This is when your muscles are gearing for repair. So if you didn’t mix up a good protein shake before entering the gym, chances are you are missing out on prime recovery time. In such cases, a fast-absorbing option like Whey Protein Isolate or WPC Protein delivers amino acids when your body needs them most.

### Between Meals to Boost Daily Intake

Struggling to meet your protein goals? Add a protein shake between meals. It’s beneficial for people aiming to gain muscle or stay full longer during the day. You can also try protein shakes as a meal replacement if you are struggling to prepare meals, are too busy at work, or are looking for satiating, high-protein, calorie-controlled meal options.

### First Thing in the Morning

After fasting overnight, your body craves nutrients. A [Breakfast Protein Shake](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/breakfast-shake) kick-starts recovery and energy levels – ideal if you hit the gym in the morning or go for early morning training sessions.

### Before Bed (e.g. Slow-Digesting Casein)

[Casein Protein](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/casein-protein-is-highly-underrated#TOC_TITLE_HDR_8) digests slowly, releasing amino acids over several hours. This makes it perfect for overnight recovery and muscle maintenance while you sleep, or when you go extended periods without food.

## How to Mix and Use Protein Powder – 3 Common Ways

There are many ways to use protein powder, so you’ll never get bored. What to mix protein powder with is not as complicated as it seems.

### The Classic Protein Shake: The most straightforward method
- With water: Fastest digestion, lower calories
- With milk: Creamier, higher protein/calcium
- Use a shaker bottle for convenience or a blender for a smoother mix

### Add It to Smoothies, Oats, or Yoghurt
Mixing protein powder into whole foods adds nutrition and flavour. Try blending it with banana, berries, oats, or Greek yoghurt.

### Bake It into High-Protein Snacks
Get your creative juices flowing with high-protein snacks like:
- High-protein muffins
- Protein pancakes
- Energy protein balls

## How Much Protein Powder Should You Use?

One standard scoop typically provides 20–25g of protein. But how much you need depends on your goals:
- Muscle building: Endurance or strength athletes should take [1.2 to 2 grams of protein](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-much-protein-per-day-build-muscle#:~:text=Protein%20is%20essential%20for%20building,kilogram%20of%20body%20weight%20daily.) per kilogram of body weight daily.
- Weight loss: Prioritise high protein to preserve lean mass in a deficit
- General maintenance: General maintenance typically requires 0.8-1.2g/kg.

Always check the label. For example, VPA’s high-quality, third-party tested WPC Protein delivers around [24g of protein](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/premium-whey-wpc) per scoop.
