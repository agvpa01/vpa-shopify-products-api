Knowing what you can and can’t eat when pregnant or breastfeeding can be really confusing. One question our team is regularly asked is if protein powder is safe to take when pregnant or breastfeeding. While protein powder is generally considered safe for breastfeeding or pregnant mothers, it’s essential to consult a healthcare provider before adding it to your diet. 

In this blog, we’ll explore important considerations and clarify common concerns around supplements for breastfeeding and expectant mothers.

### What are protein powders?

Protein powders are dietary supplements used to meet daily nutritional requirements. Made from sources like whey, soy, and pea protein, they’re commonly used to support muscle recovery and meet protein needs.

### Importance of Protein for Pregnant and Breastfeeding Mothers

Protein is one of the three macronutrients. Its role is to provide the building blocks for muscle and tissue repair. It also plays important roles in hormone and enzyme production which are essential for the many functions that occur in our body. 

Pregnant and breastfeeding women have higher protein requirements compared to other women. Pregnant women typically need around 60 grams of protein per day, while breastfeeding mothers require an additional 400-500 kcal daily beyond the standard intake. This increased protein demand is due to both the protein content in breastmilk, which nourishes the baby, and the physiological effort required for breastmilk production.

### Understanding Protein Powders and Common Types for Breastfeeding Mothers

Protein powders offer a quick and convenient solution for mothers looking to meet their daily protein requirements while breastfeeding. The two most common types of protein powder suitable for breastfeeding mothers are whey protein and plant-based protein:

- [Whey Protein Isolate (WPI) Powder Supplement](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder) is derived from dairy and provides a complete profile of essential amino acids. However, since it is sourced from cow’s milk, it’s unsuitable for those with lactose allergies or intolerances.
- Plant-based proteins (such as soy, pea, or rice) cater to mothers seeking dairy-free protein supplements. Many [vegan protein powders](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/premium-plant-vegan-protein) offer high protein content while being vegan-friendly.

Both types are safe for breastfeeding mothers, as long as they are clean, organic, and free from unnecessary additives. However, before selecting a protein powder, it’s essential to ensure that it’s safe for both mother and baby.

### Safety of Protein Powders During Breastfeeding

Protein powders are generally safe for breastfeeding mothers. However, it is important to select protein powders without synthetic additives or harmful fillers. Breastfeeding mothers should consult their healthcare provider before incorporating any protein powder to confirm that it aligns with their nutritional needs and does not interfere with other supplements or medications.

Now that we know how to choose a breastfeeding-safe protein powder, let’s explore some of the best protein powder options for pregnant and breastfeeding mothers.

### Best Protein Powders for Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### 1. Organic whey protein:

Organic whey protein while breastfeeding provides complete protein and is easy to mix into smoothies or foods. It is ideal for mothers without any dairy allergies or intolerances.

#### 2. Plant-based protein:

For mothers seeking a dairy-free option, plant-based protein powders, such as those made from pea, rice, or soy, are easily digestible and high in protein.

#### 3. Clean, prebiotic-infused protein:

Looking for something extra? Protein powders with added prebiotics can do wonders for your gut health. A happy gut can contribute to better digestion and potentially enhance milk production.

While breastfeeding protein powders can be a great addition to the diet, some ingredients can do more harm than good for breastfeeding mothers. It’s equally important to be cautious about certain ingredients that can impact both the mother's and the baby’s health.

### Ingredients to Avoid

Here are some ingredients to avoid while looking for a breastfeeding-friendly protein powder:

- Artificial sweeteners and sugar alcohols: These can upset digestion and cause gas or bloating.
- Caffeine and stimulants: Protein powders for athletes sometimes contain caffeine or weight-loss blends, which should be avoided to protect the baby from unwanted stimulants.
- Common allergens: Mothers allergic to certain ingredients should look for potential allergens such as soy, nuts, wheat, and eggs before choosing a protein supplement.
- Non-organic ingredients: Look for organic certification by the USDA and non-GMO verification to avoid industrial toxic ingredients and added hormones. Also, ensure the breastfeeding protein powder is free from any harmful additives.

There are definitely some VPA® products that you should not take if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. Any products with caffeine and other stimulants should be avoided, as should excessive intake of caffeine from coffee. VPA® products that contain caffeine and other stimulants include [Pre-30](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/pre-30-v2-pre-workout), [Summer FomoTM](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/summer-fomo), and [Venom](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/venom-pre-workout).
