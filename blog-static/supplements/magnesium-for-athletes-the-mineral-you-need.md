## Why do athletes need magnesium?

Magnesium is an important electrolyte and is essential for athletes. It is critical for nerve and muscle function and is essential for maintaining bone health. Magnesium also acts in all the soft tissues cells and enzyme systems. It is involved in blood pressure, immunity, energy and insulin metabolism. Ensuring sufficient magnesium helps with optimal recovery, oxygen uptake and energy production. A magnesium deficiency may result in muscle spasms, nerve twitches, cramping, and fatigue.

## How can I get enough magnesium?

Magnesium is readily available in both plant and animal foods. However, in the last [Australian health survey about one in three Australians do not meet their magnesium requirements](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/4364.0.55.008~2011-12~Main%20Features~Magnesium~406). Magnesium-rich foods include green leafy vegetables (e.g., spinach, broccoli, and kale), nuts, seeds, lentils, and whole grains. Caffeinated and carbonated drinks, diuretics, and alcohol can leach magnesium from your system.

## Do athletes need more magnesium?

Runners and athletes may have higher magnesium needs than the average person because of sweat losses. Also, they put more stress on their bones and muscles. If you’re having a tougher time than usual recovering from hard workouts, or you’re experiencing muscle spasms or shin splints, you may be deficient in magnesium. [Even a marginal deficiency in magnesium may impair performance and amplify the effects of oxidative stress on the body.](https://examine.com/supplements/magnesium/)

A blood test cannot indicate magnesium deficiency. This is because only one percent of magnesium in the body is circulating in the blood. The rest is in the bones and muscles. So you’ll need to review your diet to figure out whether you are deficient.
