Whether you're lifting heavy in the gym, powering through an intense HIIT session, or sprinting “for life,” the right pre-workout snack can make all the difference. Just like a pilot won’t fly a plane without refuelling, you shouldn’t train your body without consuming the right food first.

But what counts as a good pre-workout snack? And how soon should you eat before exercising? This guide explores all that – plus gives you 15 snack ideas tailored to your taste and training goals.

## Why Your Pre-Workout Snack Matters

You may wonder - Am I not getting enough protein in my meals? Are my supplements not enough to complement?

Indeed, balanced nutrition matters, but what matters the most is the snack you take just pre-workout to boost your performance, energy levels, and even recovery. And when you don’t have healthy pre-workout snacks, you tend to grab the sugar-heavy, processed options.

Here’s why it should never be overlooked:

### Boosts energy and performance

Eating the right pre-gym snack gives your muscles access to quick fuel, especially if you're consuming fast-digesting carbs and protein-rich snacks pre-workout. It means you’ll train harder and for longer without hitting a stop.

### Supports muscle function and endurance

When paired with the right amount of protein, your snack can support better muscle output and reduce breakdown, which is key for those muscle builds you are always chasing. Protein-rich pre-workout snacks for muscle gain are, thus, the way to go.

### Prevents mid-workout fatigue or dizziness

Low blood sugar can be an enemy to a good workout, leading to early fatigue, light-headedness or even nausea. A well-timed pre-workout snack helps you maintain your energy throughout the workout.

## When Should You Eat Before Working Out?

Aim to eat your pre-workout snack around 60 to 90 minutes before your session for optimal digestion and energy availability. If you're short on time, a light pre-workout option with approximately 100 calories, such as VPA Australia’s Protein Ball Mix, is a better choice.

## What Makes a Good Pre-Workout Snack?

A good pre-workout snack is made from simple ingredients that provide you with fuel without weighing you down. Here's what to include:

### Carbohydrates for fuel

Fast-digesting carbs, consumed pre-workout, help replenish glycogen, which stores glucose primarily in the liver and muscles, providing immediate energy. Think rice cakes, bananas, or toast with honey.

### Protein for muscle support

Protein helps protect muscle during intense training and aids in recovery. Options like [protein powder](https://www.vpa.com.au/collections/protein-powder), Protein Mousse, or VPA’s quick and easy pancake mix are ideal.

### Low fat and low fibre to avoid discomfort

Fat is the primary fuel for longer, moderate exercise. Fibre, though, digests slowly and can cause bloating or cramping if consumed too close to exercise. Save your high-fibre meals for post-workout instead.

## Should You Have a Snack if You’re Already Taking Pre-Workout Supplements?

Yes – [pre-workout supplements](https://www.vpa.com.au/collections/pre-workout-supplements) are designed to enhance focus, pump, and stamina, but they don’t replace actual food. Your body still needs calories, carbs, protein, and other micronutrients to perform well from a well-balanced diet. Think of your pre-workout snack as fuel, and your pre-workout supplement as just the boost. Moreover, real food adds taste to life, and healthier protein optio...
