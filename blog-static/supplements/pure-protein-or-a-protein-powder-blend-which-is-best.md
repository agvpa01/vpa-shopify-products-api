### Is a pure protein powder or protein powder blend the best choice for you? What is the difference between them? Now, it’s important to note that when we say “protein blend” we are not talking about inferior products sold by some supplement companies. These poor quality products blend protein powder with fillers such a fibre and milk powder and they have a lower protein content than high quality protein powders. Read on to discover what a good quality protein blend powder is, and how it might benefit you.

### What is a pure protein powder?

A pure protein powder is one made with only one protein source and protein type. Examples of pure protein powders include [whey protein isolate](/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder), [whey protein concentrate](/products/premium-whey-wpc), casein, and [pea protein](/products/pea-protein-isolate).

### What is a protein powder blend?

A protein powder blend is one that combines protein types into the one product. Common examples of protein blends include [casein-whey blends](/products/micellar-casein), [plant protein blends](/products/premium-plant-vegan-protein), and [blends of different dairy proteins](/products/complete-tri-protein-33) such as whey protein isolate, whey protein concentrate and casein.

### Why should I choose a pure protein powder?

Pure protein powders generally provide great value for money and are great for people who use protein for a specific purpose and/or use different powders at different times. VPA® Australia sells three different pure protein powders.

### Whey protein isolate

[Whey protein isolate](/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder) is the most pure dairy protein powder on the market. WPI is a fast digesting protein that consists of at least 90% protein, with almost no carbohydrates or fats. It is also 99% lactose-free, making it suitable for most people who are lactose intolerant. WPI is the more expensive than other proteins due to it’s high purity. However [VPA® WPI](/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder) is still great value at only $40 per bag, and $1.10 a serve. WPI contains high levels of the branched chain amino acid leucine, and as a result it is the best protein to choose to take after training. WPI is most effective for stimulating muscle repair and growth.

### Whey protein concentrate

[Whey protein concentrate](/products/premium-whey-wpc) is slightly less refined that WPI and as a result it has slightly lower levels of protein and slightly higher levels of carbohydrate and fat. [VPA® WPI](/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder) has 23g of protein per serve, 0.7g of fat and 1.5g of sugars from lactose. Because the protein level is slightly lower, WPC is a cheaper alternative to WPI at only $31 per 1kg bag or $0.93 per serve. For most people it is more than adequate to take after training to promote recovery and repair.

Because it is slightly higher in fat and protein, WPC is slower to digest and generally a bit nicer to drink that WPI. Many people use WPC in oats and smoothies to help boost the protein content of their meal. The slower rate of digestion makes it better than WPI for people that have a protein shake as a snack or in place of a meal.

### Pea protein

[Pea protein](/products/pea-protein-isolate) is a plant-based protein that provides great value for money. While pea protein is considered to be a complete protein, it does not contain high amounts of branch chain amino acids. This makes it a less than ideal protein source if this is your only source of protein. However, for those following a protein rich plant-based diet in general, pea protein can be very handy for boosting your protein intake.
