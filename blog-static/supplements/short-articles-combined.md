### Is a pure protein powder or protein powder blend the best choice for you? What is the difference between them? Now, it’s important to note that when we say “protein blend” we are not talking about inferior products sold by some supplement companies. These poor quality products blend protein powder with fillers such a fibre and milk powder and they have a lower protein content than high quality protein powders. Read on to discover what a good quality protein blend powder is, and how it might benefit you.

---

### What is a pure protein powder?

A pure protein powder is one made with only one protein source and protein type. Examples of pure protein powders include [whey protein isolate](/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder), [whey protein concentrate](/products/premium-whey-wpc), casein, and [pea protein](/products/pea-protein-isolate).

---

### What is a protein powder blend?

A protein powder blend is one that combines protein types into the one product. Common examples of protein blends include [casein-whey blends](/products/micellar-casein), [plant protein blends](/products/premium-plant-vegan-protein), and [blends of different dairy proteins](/products/complete-tri-protein-33) such as whey protein isolate, whey protein concentrate and casein.

---

### Why should I choose a pure protein powder?

Pure protein powders generally provide great value for money and are great for people who use protein for a specific purpose and/or use different powders at different times. VPA[®](/products/complete-tri-protein-33) Australia sells three different pure protein powders.

---

### Whey protein isolate

[Whey protein isolate](/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder) is the most pure dairy protein powder on the market. WPI is a fast digesting protein that consists of at least 90% protein, with almost no carbohydrates or fats. It is also 99% lactose-free, making it suitable for most people who are lactose intolerant. WPI is the more expensive than other proteins due to it’s high purity. However [VPA](/products/complete-tri-protein-33)[®](/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder) WPI is still great value at only $40 per bag, and $1.10 a serve. WPI contains high levels of the branched chain amino acid leucine, and as a result it is the best protein to choose to take after training. WPI is most effective for stimulating muscle repair and growth.

---

### Whey protein concentrate

[Whey protein concentrate](/products/premium-whey-wpc) is slightly less refined that WPI and as a result it has slightly lower levels of protein and slightly higher levels of carbohydrate and fat. [VPA](/products/complete-tri-protein-33)[®](/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder) WPI has 23g of protein per serve, 0.7g of fat and 1.5g of sugars from lactose. Because the protein level is slightly lower, WPC is a cheaper alternative to WPI at only $31 per 1kg bag or $0.93 per serve. For most people it is more than adequate to take after training to promote recovery and repair.

Because it is slightly higher in fat and protein, WPC is slower to digest and generally a bit nicer to drink that WPI. Many people use WPC in oats and smoothies to help boost the protein content of their meal. The slower rate of digestion makes it better than WPI for people that have a protein shake as a snack or in place of a meal.

---

### Pea protein

[Pea protein](/products/pea-protein-isolate) is a plant-based protein that provides great value for money. While pea protein is considered to be a complete protein, it does not contain high amounts of branch chain amino acids. This makes it a less than ideal protein source if this is your only source of protein. However, for those following a protein rich plant-based diet in general, pea protein can be very handy for boosting your protein intake.

### What is colostrum?

Colostrum is a highly nutritious fluid produced by all mammals shortly after giving birth before real breast milk production begins. For supplementation, bovine colostrum is the most widely used type of colostrum produced by cows/cattle. Compared to regular cow’s milk, colostrum is extremely rich in antibodies that it can be effective in improving the immune system. It is also higher in protein, fat, carbs, vitamins and minerals compared to real milk.

### What is the keto diet?

The keto eating strategy was first discovered by Dr. Russel Wilder in France as a treatment for Epilepsy patients. They found that a common side effect for this eating strategy was weight loss. A keto diet involves an individual ingesting less than 20 grams of net carbohydrates a day. A net carbohydrate is one that is absorbed by the body. You calculate this by subtracting the fiber from the total number of carbohydrates.

A keto diet needs to be high in fat, sufficient in protein and low in carbohydrates. By restricting the amount of carbohydrates consumed, the body changes the way it produces and uses energy. Insulin levels decrease and fat stores are converted into fatty acids. Fatty acids are transported to the liver where they are oxidized, turned into ketones and used as energy. Having a high number of ketones in the blood is termed a metabolic state of ketosis. Intermittent fasting is a strategy often used to help reach and sustain ketosis.

### Supplements to take on a keto diet

Here is a list of 4 VPA® supplements you can take on a keto diet.

#### VPA® Venom® Pre Workout

For that extra bit of boost for your next workout session, you cannot go past [VPA® Venom® Pre Workout](/products/kleos-pre-workout). At only 0.8g of carbs in every serve, and less than 0.1g of sugar, this pre-workout will help you stay well under 20g of net carbs a day. The caffeine will keep you energised and the taste will keep you intrigued.

Unlike a lot of other pre-workouts on the market, Venom® Pre-workout does not contain any refined sugars. Venom® is sweetened with Thaumatin which is a Katemfe Fruit extract. This natural sweetener has a ranking of 0 on the glycemic index so it is keto friendly. Venom® also contains Ashwagandha extract. Ashwaganda regulates cortisol (commonly known as the “stress hormone”) levels which can potentially hinder muscle growth and recovery.

#### VPA® Whey Protein Isolate

## Why do athletes need magnesium?

Magnesium is an important electrolyte and is essential for athletes. It is critical for nerve and muscle function and is essential for maintaining bone health. Magnesium also acts in all the soft tissues cells and enzyme systems. It is involved in blood pressure, immunity, energy and insulin metabolism. Ensuring sufficient magnesium helps with optimal recovery, oxygen uptake and energy production. A magnesium deficiency may result in muscle spasms, nerve twitches, cramping and fatigue.

## How can I get enough magnesium?

Magnesium is readily available in both plant and animal foods. However, in the last [Australian health survey about one in three Australians do not meet their magnesium requirements](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/4364.0.55.008~2011-12~Main%20Features~Magnesium~406). Magnesium rich foods include green leafy vegetables (e.g., spinach, broccoli and kale), nuts, seeds, lentils and whole grains. Caffeinated and carbonated drinks, diuretics and alcohol can leach magnesium from your system.

## Do athletes need more magnesium?

Runners and athletes may have higher magnesium needs than the average person because of sweat losses. Also they put more stress on their bones and muscles. If you’re having a tougher time than usual recovering from hard workouts, or you’re experiencing muscle spasms or shin splints, you may be deficient in magnesium. [Even a marginal deficiency in magnesium may impair performance and amplify the effects of oxidative stress on the body.](https://examine.com/supplements/magnesium/)

A blood test cannot indicate magnesium deficiency. This is because only one per cent of magnesium in the body is circulating in the blood. The rest is in the bones and muscles. So you’ll need to review your diet to figure out whether you are deficient.

## How to supplement magnesium

[VPA magnagel contains added magnesium to promote energy and recovery](/products/magnegel-12-pack-3-flavours). Magnegel assists with maintaining adequate mineral concentrations during exercise to promote optimal performance. After exercise, Magnegel provides nutrients that positively affect energy production and recovery.

**SEO Title:** Does GABA increase growth hormone?

**SEO Description:** The good news is that there is some evidence that supplementing with GABA may increase growth hormone levels. Read on to find out more.

Most trainers and gym-goers have heard of growth hormone and know of its importance in strength gains and fat metabolism. Studies show that intense aerobic and resistance training is one way to stimulate growth hormone secretion. We know that the majority of growth hormone secretion occurs at night and a number of other studies have shown that day time secretion in relatively low. Here in lies the question – how do we boost growth hormone levels during the day in order to provide more muscle growth and fat loss? The good news is that there is some evidence that supplementing with GABA may increase growth hormone levels. Read on to find out more.

---

## What is GABA?

GABA is Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid. It is a naturally occurring amino acid compound that acts as a neurotransmitter in our brains. GABA is a nootropic or cognitive enhancer. The opposite of a stimulant, GABA acts as a depressive, but don’t let that scare you! What this means, is that GABA works to relax us and clear our minds, helping us to wind down. GABA is available as a supplement in power form. [You can find VPA® GABA here.](/products/gaba-powder)

## What does GABA do?

In relation to health and body composition, GABA plays two main roles in the body. As a relaxant GABA may help to relieve conditions such as anxiety and can help you fall asleep. Studies have shown that people who use GABA fall asleep faster and have a more restful night sleep. Secondly GABA promotes the production of growth hormones.

A recent study examined the effects of GABA on growth hormone production when combined with an intense weight lifting program. The study design looked at the growth hormone levels in men when training versus not training, when taking GABA versus taking a placebo. Further research has shown that GABA supplementation and the associated increase in growth hormone results in an increase in muscle mass. The remainder of this blog will look at the results of these studies and answer the question, does GABA increase growth hormone?

## GABA increases growth hormone levels

The first study found that 3g serve of GABA increased growth hormone levels by 375% when compared to the placebo. When weight training, taking GABA increased growth hormone levels by 175% when compared to those taking the placebo. At rest, a 3g serve of GABA increased GH levels over that of the placebo by 375%.

This shows that GABA is effective in increasing GH levels, particularly during the day when normal secretion is low. It also shows that when you perform intense training, you can enhance your natural hormone spike by taking a daily dose of GABA.

---

## GABA increases muscle mass

A second study assessed change in muscle mass when performed a resistance training regime and supplemented with either protein alone or protein plus GABA over a 12 week period. The results of the study showed that those that took GABA demonstrated not only increased growth hormone levels but a significant increase in muscle mass as measured with X-ray absorptiometry.

As can be seen, GABA does increase both growth hormone and lean muscle mass. If building muscle is one of your goals, GABA is a useful supplement for you.

# 5 Useful Supplements for Runners and Endurance Athletes

This blog will outline 5 useful supplements for runners and endurance athletes. There are supplements to optimize your recovery, improve your performance, and maintain your immunity. Whatever your chosen sport, goals or training regime there is a supplement to benefit you.

### Protein powder for endurance athletes

Protein powder supplements are not just for strength athletes or body builders. 10-20% of endurance athletes don’t meet their daily protein requirements. Protein provides the amino acids that fuel recovery and repair. Not eating enough protein may result in increased injury risk.

Recreational endurance athletes [require at least 1.65 g protein per kg of body per day.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6839090/) This intake optimises recovery and reduces chance of injury. Protein requirements are even higher in trail runners due to the extra wear and tear put on muscles and joints due to steep ascents, decents, and the uneven nature of the ground.

Protein is found in fresh foods including meat, dairy, legumes and lentils. However, endurance training requires a huge amount of time commitment. If you are juggling training around work and family, you may put nutrition on the back-burner. This is why a high quality pure protein supplement can benefit you.

### Whey protein isolate (WPI) for endurance athletes

[VPA](/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder)[®](/products/breakfast-shake)[WPI is a pure whey protein powder](/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder) that providing 27g of protein per serve. It contains a high level of the amino acid leucine which triggers muscle repair. You can mix WPI with foods including oats and yoghurt. You can also mix it with water or with milk and drink it as a simple shake. Take WPI within an hour of finishing training or racing to optimise recovery.

### Caffeine supplements for endurance athletes

### How do I know if I’m getting enough protein?

Nutrition guidelines suggest an intake of 1g of protein per kg of body weight per day. This is half of what I recommend as a performance dietitian for women chasing strength gains or hypertrophy. Protein intake is even more important if you are a woman who identifies as being part of one or more of these groups or are:

- Following a plant-based diet
- Under-eating or under-fuelling
- Eliminating food groups
- If you are peri- or post-menopausal

Women in these groups have higher protein needs, and need rapid intake of protein post-training to mitigate muscle loss and help with brain fog.

### How can BCAAs help women?

Supplementing with BCAAs could be a game-changer if you identify with one or more of the above groups. BCAAs are a cluster of three essential amino acids. The most important of these is leucine as it is the precursor to muscle protein synthesis. For women, the main benefit of BCAA lies in its intracellular signalling pathway involved in protein synthesis and it’s ability to counter central nervous system fatigue.

### How much BCAA do I need and when should I take it?

I recommend a standard dose of 5-7g of BCAAs under the following conditions:

- Before strength training in the morning if you are unable to have a high protein breakfast first.
- Women doing fasted cardio – no woman should train fasted!
- Peri- or Post- menopausal women before strength training. Whether you are a novice lifter or national record holder, BCAAs would benefit you.
- Female athletes on restrictive energy budgets who are in the late stages of elite contest preparation.

### What BCAA supplement should I take?

My preference is unflavoured BCAAs. VPA® offers [BCAA 2:1:1](/products/bcaa-2-1-1) in 200g. They also offer [BCAA 7000](/products/bcaa-7000) in 300g tubs as well as [sample packs](/products/bcaa-7000-sample-pack-5-flavours-10-samples) to try all 5 flavours. Check them out below.

**SEO Description:** What is AAKG and what are the benefits of taking AAKG? Here is our detailed discussion on taking the AAKG supplement powder.

## Content

### What is AAKG?

Anyone who is keen on taking dietary supplements or pre-workouts to fuel a good training session would have noticed the ingredient called AAKG added to it, but what is it and what are the benefits of taking it?

### What is AAKG?

AAKG is an acronym for the compound arginine-alpha-ketoglutarate. It is a natural substance that plays several essential roles in the body, including the creation of creatine, [the formation of signaling molecules, and of most importance in sports nutrition](https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/2011/03001/Effect_of_L_Arginine_Alpha_Ketoglutarate_Ingestion.176.aspx), is an essential part of the nitric oxide cycle. AAKG can increase energy levels and improve blood flow which is why it is often found in pre-workout supplements, providing that great pump feeling. AAKG is effectively a nitrate supplement.

### What are nitrate supplements?

Nitrate is a naturally occurring organic compound of nitrogen and oxygen that can be found in many natural foods we eat especially leafy greens like spinach, silverbeet, and even bok choy. Nitrate supplements work through various pathways to increase nitric oxide levels in our blood. Nitric oxide relaxes and opens our blood vessels, promoting blood flow and nutrient delivery to our muscles.

### What are the benefits of AAKG?

1. Increased endurance – the delivery of more oxygen and nutrients to muscles increases exercise capacity. For endurance athletes this means being able to run longer or faster. In the gym this means being able to pump out more reps or use heavier weights.

2. Reduced muscle fatigue – the delivery of more blood to muscles allows the muscles fatigue slower and recover faster.

3. Bigger pumps – the opening of blood vessels, promotes blood flow and maximises pumps in the gym.

### AAKG FAQ

#### What should I mix AAKG with?

As pure AAKG is unflavoured and may taste slightly bitter, it can be mixed with any other VPA® products. AAKG can be mixed with water, juice, or electrolyte drinks – pretty much anything you want, however, be aware that you may still be able to taste it in these fluids.

#### AAKG dosage

The optimal dose of AAKG is 3-6g. One 200g tub of AAKG has 66 3g serves. One serve is about ½ a teaspoon, but for accuracy we recommend weighing a serve of AAKG using microscales.

#### What is the best time to take AAKG?

It is best to take the AAKG powder about 20 minutes before training to give it time to enter the nitric oxide cycle and start working. To maintain high AAKG levels for the entire day, you can take AAKG up to three times a day to a maximum dose of 15-18g.

#### How to store AAKG and amino acid clumping

Amino acids tend to take on moisture. Once your AAKG is opened, it should be stored in a cool dark location to keep it as moisture-free as possible. It is highly recommended to be consumed within 60 days once it is opened. If your AAKG starts to clump, rest assured that although it may be more difficult to scoop but it will still work just as well.

#### Does VPA® have AAKG samples?

Unfortunately, we do not have samples of AAKG available.

**SEO Title:** What are fat burners?

**SEO Description:** This blog will help explain what fat burners are, what they do, and whether or not a fat burner will help you on your journey to become leaner.

There are a tonne of different fat burners on the market, this can lead to a lot of confusion when trying to decide which fat burner is best for you, and if they even work at all. This blog will help explain what fat burners are and whether or not it taking one will help your progress towards becoming leaner.

## So, what are fat burners?

Fat burning supplements are blends of compounds that work in multiple ways to help speed up fat loss. Depending on their ingredients, they may speed your metabolism, promote fat burning, boost energy and control your hunger. The best fat burning supplements will perform more than one of these actions. They may improve your bodies ability to burn its own fat, therefore accelerating fat loss. 

Fat burners are available in both powder or capsule form. Powders are usually more useful and versatile, as they contain higher amounts of the active ingredients, and you are more easily able to adjust the dose to meet your needs. This is important as we all have a different tolerance to stimulants, and may need to adjust our intake depending on the time of day fat burner is being used.

## What do fat burners do?

Fat burner supplements act through multiple pathways to assist in the fat loss process. They are designed to be used along side your regular diet and exercise regime to accelerate fat loss. Keep in mind that if you don’t have your diet under control, no fat burning product is going to be able to help you lean out.

## Fat burners may increase metabolic rate

Many fat burner supplements contain thermogenic ingredients. This is why fat burners are sometimes referred to as “thermogenics”. Thermogenic ingredients work to increase your metabolic rate. An increase in metabolic rate means that you burn more energy, and this in turn can increase the rate at which you burn your own body fat. Common thermogenic ingredients include caffeine, green tea, and compounds derived from chili and pepper etc.

## Fat burners may increase the rate at which you burn fat

Many fat burners include ingredients such as L-carnitine which can increase the rate at which you are able to burn fat. L-carnitine plays a vital role in transporting fatty acids into our cells mitochondria, where they are oxidised to produce energy.

## Fat burners increase your mental arousal

Nearly all fat burner supplements will contain one or more stimulants which increase alertness and improve cognition. This helps you train harder, and burn more energy. In sports science, stimulants are said to “decrease the rate of perceived exertion”. This means your training feels easier, which allows you to then push to a new level of speed or strength to get more out of your workout.

## Do fat burners work?

We know you are wondering, do fat burners actually work? Should I use a fat burner? The evidence surrounding the effectiveness of fat burning supplements is mixed.

Fat burners are not a miracle supplement. We all know that you can’t out train a bad diet, right? Well similarly, you can’t “out fat burn” a poor diet and minimal training regime. However, for those that already have their diet under control by eating at a calorie deficit, or those that are already at a lower body fat percentage, a fat burner may accelerate the fat loss process or help move those last few stubborn kilos.

## VPA® Fat Burner: Summer FOMO

[Summer FOMO™](/products/summer-fomo) is the best fat burning supplement on the market. Unlike other popular brands, we believe in disclosing our full ingredients list and nutrition information to customers, so you can make an informed decision about the supplements you choose to take.

## What is Whey Protein?

Physical exercise and athletic performance requires specific macronutrients, especially protein and carbohydrates to replenish glycogen stores and to provide enough protein to build and repair muscle (1). The ideal source of such proteins is through whole foods such as meats, eggs, seafood and other high protein foods. However, to ensure that our body is able to meet the amount of protein required, [high-quality whey protein](/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder) can be a good supplement.

This article will help you understand everything you need to know about whey protein and allow you to make an informed purchasing decision next time you are in the market for a protein powder.

---

## How Does Whey Protein Work?

Many people do not understand where whey protein comes from, or even what whey is. Well, whey is a by-product of cheese manufacturing. It is the liquid that is left over after the milk has been processed. Although there are many uses for whey, it is now most popular within sports supplementation because of its high protein content and fast digestion speed.

---

### 3 types of whey protein:

1. [Whey protein concentrate or WPC](/products/premium-whey-wpc). WPC is the slowest digesting of the three, and consists of approximately 29%-89% protein, with minimal, but slightly higher levels of carbohydrates and fats than the other two whey proteins. WPC also has more lactose, this is why those who have sensitivities to lactose often choose WPI as their protein source.

2. [Whey protein isolate or WPI](/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder). WPI is a very fast digesting whey protein and consists of at least 90% protein, with almost no carbohydrates or fats. WPI is also 99% lactose-free, making it the more popular of the whey proteins.

3. Whey protein hydrolysate or WPH. WPH is the least popular of the three whey proteins due to its bitter taste a higher price. Although it is the fastest digesting of the three, it is only fractionally faster than the WPI, making the WPI and WPC the commonly used protein supplements for physical exercise.

### What does protein do? Why does my body need protein?

As should be done every day, eating a healthy diet regularly and building up your defenses from the inside should be a must during this [coronavirus (COVID-19)](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/australia/) global pandemic. Good nutrition is crucial for health especially in times when the immune system needs to be in its best shape. While keeping a balanced diet is important, let’s focus on the **health benefits of protein**.

Protein is an important macronutrient that plays a major role in the entire body. It’s responsible for **building hormones and enzymes** in our body while helping us keep our **muscles, bones, blood, hair and nails healthy**.

Protein helps **build and repair muscle** to give you **strength and mobility** and increase **fat burning**. It maintains and **repairs tissues** helping to heal wounds and keep organs healthy. Protein is also responsible for making antibodies that **optimize the immune system**, helping to fight infections and diseases.

### What are examples of protein-rich foods?

While limited access to fresh foods may seem like a roadblock to eating healthy these days, that’s not the case! Stocking on protein-rich foods may be easier than you think once you breeze through our list below.

*Note: Must be refrigerated.*

### Seafood

Seafood is an excellent source of essential nutrients including immunity supporting zinc and magnesium. It is high in protein and often low in fat. Fish such as salmon is a little higher in fat, but it is the heart-healthy kind: it has omega-3 fatty acids.

### White-Meat Poultry

White meat poultry is an excellent source of lean protein, especially chicken breast. Dark meat is a little higher in fat.

### Lean Red-Meats

Red meats are a good source of high-quality protein provided that the options are lean, like lean beef or pork tenderloin cuts.

### Eggs

Eggs are an excellent source of protein, nutrients, and healthful fats. While whole eggs are high in protein, it’s good to note that eating just the egg whites is almost pure protein. Eggs and food containing eggs are not suitable for people with an egg allergy.

An alternative to fresh eggs is our [VPA® Egg Protein](/products/egg-protein). Not only is egg protein powder perfect for those with dairy allergies and are lactose intolerant, it contains complete protein with all 9 essential amino acids and is low in fats and carbohydrates.

### Milk, Cottage cheese and Yogurt

Dairy products are excellent sources of protein and calcium to keep bones and teeth strong. They are also good sources of probiotics, which are good bacteria that can help promote a healthy gut and immune system.

Probiotics are also found to be effective for fighting the common cold and influenza-like respiratory infections. For those on a dairy-free diet or who are lactose intolerant, we suggest the [plant-based milk](/products/premium-plant-vegan-protein) soy milk which is also high in protein. Note that almond milk, other nut milks, and coconut milk are not suitable high protein milk alternatives.

### Protein on-the-go

During quarantine or self-isolation you might find it convenient to stock up on [protein supplements](/collections/protein-powder). Protein powder can be stored easily, does not expire quickly, and can help you meet your daily protein requirements. The best protein powder to buy are dairy protein if your diet allows for it. Whey protein powder and casein powder are the most bio-available proteins you can buy and are a cheap protein to add to your diet.

Our more popular products are our pure protein powders [Whey Protein Isolate (WPI)](/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder) and [Whey Protein Concentrate (WPI)](/products/premium-whey-wpc). If you are wondering “what is the difference between WPI and WPC?”, you can read more about that [here](https://vpa-australia.myshopify.com/blogs/supplements/wpi-vs-wpc-what-s-the-difference), but in summary WPI is more refined and has a higher whey protein content than WPC. Both whey protein powders make a great addition to your cooking, baking, breakfast smoothies and more!

### What is collagen?

Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body and is responsible for providing structure and strength to our connective tissues. Connective tissues include tendons, ligaments, bones, and cartilage. Most sports people will at some point experience injury to these tissues. Connective tissues heal very slowly in comparison to other tissues. This can cause frustration and subsequent re-injury if you return to high training loads without adequate rehab or healing time. This blog will discuss the evidence for collagen supplementation for tendon repair.

---

### What does the evidence say about collagen supplementation for tendon repair?

Taking 15g collagen with around 48mg of Vitamin C, 30-60mins prior to targeted training such as jumping, [doubles collagen production](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5183725/) after those sessions, when compared to a placebo. This is great evidence for the effectiveness of collagen supplementation for tendon repair. 15g of collagen is around one serve of [VPA® Collagen Pro®](/products/collagen-pro-r).

Collagen intake improves function, instability, and pain perception in ligament and joint damage. Crucially, the studies that produced positive results combined supplementation with targeted tendon/joint exercises or resistance training. The theory is that the additional availability of the key amino acids required for collagen production allows the tissues to strengthen in the direction and for the purpose of the targeted activity. So, taking collagen supplements without complementary exercises is unlikely to have any effect on injury healing or the prevention of injury.

### Benefits that pre-workouts can provide and why

- Caffeine is contained in most pre-workout supplements deliver an energy boost, helping workout intensity and workouts last longer.
- Ingredients such as beta-alanine help to improve the explosiveness of repetitions and overall increase in exercise performance.
- Vascularity can be increased from improved blood flow granted from caffeine (faster heart beat) and also more directly from substances that have main roles of making the ‘pump’ greater (below). This is because altering the pumped up sensation when training is achieved by manipulating blood flow and visually this can have changes as the veins have to adapt as well, they go hand in hand.
- L-Citrulline is converted to L-arginine by the kidneys, another amino acid which increases the production of nitric oxide in a bid to increase nitric oxide. This allows the arteries to relax and increase blood flow throughout the body resulting in greater muscle pumps to be achieved, as more blood, oxygen and nutrients are able to enter working muscle groups. L-Citrulline has also been shown to improve overall athletic performance in healthy individuals.

**Negatives of pre workouts:**
- Constant use of caffeine can produce a type of dependency for the body if consumed consistently. Similar to your daily coffee, one should be careful of producing a habit and not feel the need to use a pre workout for every single workout if they participate in training most days of the week.
- New pre workouts are released constantly by new companies and one should hesitate and learn more about what is contained in each one before consuming. It is recommended to be inclined to purchase supplements produced by proven and trusted companies, but even then you should familiarise yourself with the ingredients and check to see if the pre workout is approved by a governing body to ensure it is safe and legal for competition sports.

**When to use/Best implementation:**
Pre-workouts give a burst of ‘energy’ soon after being consumed. While it depends on how much food the user has eaten prior etc. it still will make the person feel the effects of the certain ingredients within 20 minutes, this is also altered by the amount consumed of the product.

**Which should you buy?**
Pre-workouts are one of the most popular supplements on the market, only probably surpassed in sales by things such as whey protein. Pre-workouts may even continue to grow as people enjoy the feeling of having all the extra energy to make the workout more intense than usual. As mentioned earlier many companies are launching pre-workouts with stronger and stronger formulas, and as a result we are finding many formulas are found to have high-risk ingredients which are banned in competitive sport. So it is very important that you find a pre-workout that is developed and blended by a brand that ensures all of their products are compliant with ASADA/WADA, to reduce the chance of cross-contamination.

The best recommendation with this knowledge is to go to a trusted brand, that doesn’t add in more and more rarely seen ingredients just to try and achieve something new or push the boundaries. This is why we recommend using VPA® The benefits of [Gold Coast Stim](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/gold-coast-stim-pre-workout/) (formerly Pre-30 V.2), since all of our products are 100% ASADA/WADA compliant and safe for consumption, but still deliver the full-energy and performance boosting benefits you need in a pre-workout.

With so many different types of protein powders on the market, choosing the best protein for you can be confusing. It’s not surprising that the most commonly asked question we receive is, what protein powder should I be using? In this article, we will focus on the five most popular protein types to help you make the best choice.

---

## Why should I use protein powder?

Protein powder is one of the most purchased supplements on the market. This is because it serves a dual purpose that many other supplements don’t. Firstly it’s a food that helps you feel satiated and full. You can take it on it’s own as a shake, mixed in with a smoothie or some oats. You can even use it in recipes to make high protein snack. Secondly, as a sports supplement protein powder is one of few supplements for which strong scientific evidence for it’s effectiveness exits.

Protein is made up of amino acids which are used in our body for muscle growth and repair. Protein is a vitally important nutrient for those wanting to grow muscles and increase strength. It is also important for those that give themselves a beating during training and need to optimise recovery. Amino acids play other essential roles in the body including the synthesis of hormones, enzymes and neurotransmitters. Amino acids are also a source of energy during intense exercise. Put simply, protein is vital to maintaining health.

While most people can get enough protein through their usual diet, protein powder is a convenient source of high quality pure protein.

---

## When should I take protein powder?

Protein powder can be taken at any time of day. However, if you are looking to maximise muscle building and recovery you should take it before or after exercise. Around 30 minutes before, and within an hour after training is ideal.

---

## What are the different types of protein powder?

The most common protein powders are derived from dairy milk. Whey protein isolate (WPI), whey protein concentrate (WPC) and casein are the three different protein powders that are processed. Whey protein concentrate and whey protein isolate differ only in their processing and purity. You can read more about that here.

---

### Whey Protein Isolate

WPI is cold filtered two times and when pure, has around a 90% protein content. If your WPI is not around 90% protein, then it is not really WPI! Because of the extra processing costs and higher purity, WPI is more expensive than other protein types. WPI is the fastest digesting protein, and is ideal for instigating muscle building and repair after exercise. It’s high leucine content means that it is superior to other protein powders if you are looking to maximise muscle building. It’s low lactose content means it is well tolerated by most people who need a lactose free protein powder due to lactose intolerance. WPI is an ideal healthy snack as protein is the most satiating of the three macronutrients, and is low in calories. This makes WPI the best protein for losing weight.

VPA® Whey Protein Isolate is a pure whey isolate protein and the best whey protein powder on the market. With a 90% protein content and 14 delicious flavours, and great mixability WPI is the best protein for most people.

Find out more about our pure [whey protein isolate](https://vpa-australia.myshopify.com/collections/protein-powder/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder).

---

### Whey Protein Concentrate

WPC is only filtered one time, and therefore has a slightly higher carbohydrate and fat content compared to WPI. A pure whey protein concentrate should have around 80% protein. The slightly higher carb and fat content means that WPC is more slowly digested and absorbed compared to WPI. This is useful if you want a protein that will keep you feeling a little more full in between meals. It also gives the protein a slightly creamier taste and texture when made on water, and some people find it more enjoyable to drink than WPI for this reason. WPC is also a good choice of protein to lose weight. Although it is slightly higher in calories than WPI, it does make for a more complete meal and can lead to you feeling more satisfied.

VPA® Whey Protein Concentrate is a pure whey concentrate and the best WPC on the market. With an 80% protein content and 14 flavours, you won’t find a better value high-quality protein anywhere.

### What is BCAA?

This blog will explain all you need to know about branched chain amino acids. What are BCAAs, what are they useful for, and is it a supplement that you should be adding to your daily routine?

---

### What is BCAA?

BCAA stands for Branched Chain Amino Acids. Amino acids are the building blocks of protein and they have many vital roles within the body. There are 20 different amino acids that we need to be healthy. Of these 20, nine are considered ‘essential’. Essential amino acids can’t be made within our body and must be consumed as part of a healthy diet. Of these essential amino acids, three are branched chain amino acids.

The three branched chain amino acids are called leucine, isoleucine, and valine. They are called branched chain amino acids because they have a branch-like structure. Their structure means that they are not processed in the liver before entering the blood stream. Instead they directly enter the blood stream and can be immediately used for protein synthesis and energy production.

Leucine plays an important role in muscle protein synthesis, while isoleucine induces glucose uptake into cells. Further research is needed to determine valine’s role in a BCAA supplement, but what we do know is that they are most effective when taken in combination. As is so often the way in human nutrition, the sum of the whole is much more important than it’s parts.

---

### What are the benefits of BCAA?

Due to their rapid absorption into the blood stream, BCAAs maximise muscle growth and repair, fuel training, and play other important roles. Lets look at these benefits in a bit more detail.

---

### BCAAs build muscle

Leucine could be considered the king of the amino acids when it comes to building muscle. Leucine is highly researched, and there is a large body of evidence supporting its role in triggering muscle repair and growth. A serve of BCAA will ensure you receive enough leucine to stimulate the muscle building response after training. A 5g serve of leucine will optimise muscle repair and growth when taken around training.

---

### BCAAs can reduce fatigue

There is some research to suggest that BCAA may decrease the rate at which you tire from exercise. Taking BCAA helps restore the levels of another essential amino acid, tryptophan, in the brain. Our bodies convert tryptophan into serotonin, the happy hormone, and this can help reduce perceived exhaustion during exercise. This can make exercise feel easier than it actually is, helping you to push harder for longer. This is similar to the role that caffeine plays, in that it improves our rate of perceived exertion.

---

### BCAAs are used as fuel and prevent breakdown of muscles

During intense exercise, our bodies use branched chain amino acids as a fuel source. This is especially true if you are on a low carbohydrate diet. When carbohydrate availability is low, our bodies must increasingly rely on protein oxidisation to produce energy. If our blood levels of BCAA are low, we start to break down muscle tissue to use as fuel. This is not desirable as it makes recovery more taxing and kills our gains! Taking a supplement ensures you have a ready supply of BCAA in your bloodstream to use as fuel if needed.

The below table summarises the evidence surrounding the use of BCAA supplements, as taken from [https://examine.com/supplements/branched-chain-amino-acids/](https://examine.com/supplements/branched-chain-amino-acids/)

---

### Should I be using BCAA?

Essential amino acids should be eaten or taken daily. BCAA is purchased in powder form. You can take it in a capsule, or mix the powder with the liquid of your choice to drink it. BCAA powder comes as either an unflavoured pure BCAA such as our [BCAA 211](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/bcaa), or as part of a intra-workout drink like our [BCAA7000](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/bcaa7000).

### Collagen is the Body’s Scaffolding

Collagen is often referred to as the body’s scaffolding, as it is the protein that glues the body together and one of the most abundant proteins found in the human body.

### So What is Collagen?

Collagen is the most abundant source of protein in our body and is made up of long chains of linked amino acids. Collagen are the building blocks of our connective tissue, which is essential to the function of our muscles, tendons, ligaments, bones, skin, blood vessels and digestive system.

Unfortunately, the production of our natural collagen begins to decline in our mid-twenties at a rate of 1.5% per year, but by consuming collagen you can combat this decline. Our dietary source of quality collagen comes from parts of the animals that aren’t popular in today’s diet. Traditional diets that would use the whole animal were rich in collagen, whereas modern diets lack this collagen and need help from a quality supplement. So unless you wanting to boil bones to create bone broth every day, you may need a quality collagen supplement. But not all collagen supplements are made the same, you need to be careful.

You need to be sure that you find a collagen supplement that is in a format that our body can easily access and use. Hydrolyzed collagen is what you need, which simply means that it contains a smaller molecular structure making it easier for the collagen peptides to enter your bloodstream and be transported to the area your body most needs it.

**SEO Description:** Learn about the benefits of using a casein protein before bed to improve your strength gains, muscle size, and fat metabolism.

### According to a review published in *Frontiers in Nutrition*, drinking a casein protein before sleep can increase gains in muscle mass and strength, and protein calories consumed before bed does not increase body fat. These findings suggest that sleep is a unique window for boosting muscle gains.

"Several one-night studies have shown that pre-sleep protein intake increases muscle protein synthesis during overnight sleep in young adults" says lead author Dr. Tim Snijders, Assistant Professor at Maastricht University, who conducted the most compelling study to support these findings to date.

Dr. Tim Snijders studied 44 healthy young men over a 12-week lifting program. Half of the men were given a protein shake before sleep with about 30g of casein and 15 grams of carbs. After the 12 weeks both groups had improved their squat (one rep max) and had bigger quads, but the group that consumed the protein shake before bed had significantly more muscle strength and size.

---

### Sleep is the perfect opportunity for muscle recovery and growth

---

Muscle repair and growth can only occur when amino acids (protein) is available in the blood. But the body does not store and release amino acids into the blood (like glucose) to maintain near-constant circulating levels. Snijders states, protein before sleep is used to improve protein intake distribution over the day.

"A survey of over 500 athletes found they were typically consuming at total of more than 1.2g protein per kilo of bodyweight across three main meals, but only a paltry 7g of protein as an evening snack. As a result, lower levels of amino acids would be available for muscle growth during overnight sleep."

---

### Bedtime protein won’t ‘make you fat’ or ruin your sleep

---

"In an 8-week morning vs evening casein study, the additional consumption of protein calories did not result in any increase in fat mass despite the fact that exercise volume did not change," states Snijders. He goes on to state that "Supporting this, another group found in 11 young active men that a pre-sleep casein shake actually increased the rate of fat burning the following day. This might be because casein ingestion reduces the insulin response to subsequent meals, which pushes your body to use more fat."

This suggests that consuming protein, especially casein before bed, doesn’t appear to ‘make you fat, in fact, it seems to increase fat metabolism.

So in conclusion, consider using a casein protein before bed to improve your strength gains, muscle size, and fat metabolism.

## We all know protein is king

We all know protein is king. Protein is not only essential for [building muscle](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/training/8-proven-ways-to-grow-muscle?_pos=3&_sid=40277b5f1&_ss=r), but it also plays a role for brain cell function and creating hormones and enzymes that are vital to essential physiological processes in our bodies.

In another blog, we’ve tackled [how much protein we actually need](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/how-much-protein-do-i-need?_pos=1&_sid=3bfb104f6&_ss=r). And found that protein intake differs for everybody, depending on variables such as age, gender, and body weight. Researchers from McMaster University in Hamilton did a meta-analysis on a total of 1,863 people, including men and women, young and old, and experienced weight trainers as well as novices. They have found that people around the age of 40 and up need to increase the amount of protein in their diets as the decline in protein from the body’s muscles begin in our 40s and 50s.

## What happens in our bodies over the age 40?

### 1. Your body was not like it used to be.

Once we reach our 40s or 50s, we begin losing muscle mass at a much faster rate. In the same way, our bodies are less likely to make protein compared to a 20-year-old body. Therefore, it is best to increase the amount of protein intake to preserve muscle mass.

### What are some of the hindrances to increasing protein intake?

- Reduced appetite
- Dental issues
- Impaired taste, swallowing problems
- Limited financial resources

---

### 2. You are moving less.

As we age, we *typically* adapt to a more sedentary lifestyle when work occupies a huge role in our lives, and we are tucked away behind a desk for more than half of our lives. If that is not the case for you, then kudos to you!

But generally, when older adults are more sedentary, the body becomes accustomed to this and will not waste energy synthesizing protein for muscles if it sees that the body’s muscles won’t be used. Thus, the expression: ‘use it or lose it.’

---

### 3. You are eating less.

Older adults often find their appetites decrease as they age and so they end up eating less and not meeting their daily required food guidelines. The human body is beautiful and quite a smart machine. However, for our survival, when we eat lesser, or do not eat enough protein, our body sources it elsewhere; our muscles. And this could speed up muscle loss even faster.

---

## What are the health risks for older adults who consume less protein in their diet?

- Deteriorating muscles
- Impact on functionality/ Compromised mobility
- Slower recovery from illnesses
- Loss of independence

The only solution is keeping your protein intake up as well as develop a more active lifestyle. In the case of chronic illnesses as an issue, especially with kidney disease, we highly recommend visiting and consulting your doctors first before making changes to your diet.

If you are or know someone who is over 40, let them know about the importance of increasing their protein intake to enhance their performance and recovery.

### What is creatine?

Creatine is a naturally occurring compound in our bodies. Our liver, and to a lesser extent our pancreas and kidneys, produce creatine using the amino acids glycine and arginine. We also get it from foods including red meat and seafood. Creatine molecules act as storage units for high energy phosphate groups, which are an essential part of our energy production system. Creatine increases the rate at which we can use energy within our bodies. If you want to know more about this science you can check out this blog.

### Why should I take creatine?

#### 1. It works

Creatine is one of the most extensively researched supplements available. Research has examined its benefits on sports performance, body composition, and general health. The evidence supporting the use of creatine to improve sports performance and build muscle is so strong that it is classified by the AIS as a Group A performance supplement. This means that it has measurably improved sports performance. [Creatine has the following proven benefits](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3963244/).

#### 2. It is cheap

Creatine is without a doubt one of the cheapest and cost-effective supplements you can buy. If you’re on a budget, creatine is for you! [VPA® creatine monohydrate](/products/creatine-monohydrate) comes in two sizes. We sell 200g for $17, which is 43c a serve, and 1kg for $27, which is 14c a serve. Told you it’s a bargain!

#### 3. It is versatile

Creatine is almost flavorless and is sold as a natural powder with no added flavor. It has a slightly bitter taste and sometimes may have a slightly grainy texture, but most people find it palatable. Being unflavored means that it can be added to anything you are drinking. Many people like to add it to their protein shake, but it can just as easily be added to juice or taken in plain water.

### OK, so how should I take creatine?

We’ve convinced you that you need it, and now you are wondering how to take it. For best results, creatine should be taken in a 5-7 day loading phase of around 20g per day. This should be followed by daily supplementation of 2-5g a day depending on your body weight. It can be taken on its own in water or with other supplements. To read about this in more detail, [check out this blog](/blogs/supplements/do-you-need-to-cycle-creatine).

### The best time to take creatine

The benefits of creatine are best seen when the levels within our muscles are consistently high. This means that it should be taken every day, with the timing of when you do so being unimportant. Creatine is not a supplement you need to take immediately before you train. Many people add it to their daily routine by taking it with their other supplements in the morning, or simply in water at the same time each day.

## What is L-Carnitine?
You’ve probably heard the [L-carnitine](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/l-carnitine?variant=32462615085111) is a fat-burner and can assist in performance, but probably unaware of the science behind the amino acid. Firstly an amino acid is the building block of proteins. L-carnitine is an amino acid that is naturally produced in the body within the liver and kidneys. Although L-carnitine is primarily stored within the muscle, including the brain. Now let’s deep dive into the questions of what is l-carnitine and how it works in your body.

---

## L-Carnitine and Energy
L-carnitine is involved in energy metabolism and mitochondrial protection (mitochondria are essentially the heart of your cells). L-carnitine is able to alleviate the effects of ageing and disease on mitochondria while increasing the mitochondria’s potential to burn fat.

---

## L-Carnitine and Fat Burning
Carnitine is an essential nutrient for the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix, using fat stores for energy. Researchers have found that carnitine is essential in the oxidation of lipids.

---

Looking at the synthesis of carnitine it requires two amino acids lysine & methionine and three vitamins, ascorbate, niacin and vitamin B6 and a metal ion (reduce iron). A deficiency in any of one of these nutrients would result in considerably impaired carnitine synthesis.
The muscles of the body, as well as many other tissues, depend primarily on fatty acid oxidation as a source of energy. Because they cannot synthesize carnitine, its transport into these tissues is of critical importance*.

## How do you consume L-Carnitine?
L-carnitine can be obtained by diet, primarily found in meat and other animal products but also sound in some plant products like soybeans, nuts, seeds, asparagus, broccoli, garlic, parsley, kale, bananas, bee pollen, corn, rice bran, oatmeal, whole wheat etc. The standard supplementation dose for L-carnitine is between 500-2,000mg, which can be hard to consume from only food sources, and this is why an L-Carnitine supplement can be extremely effective.

### We take flavour very seriously here at [VPA®](https://vpa-australia.myshopify.com/), which is why our R&D team spends thousands of hours formulating and sorting through hundreds of flavours to get you the most delicious protein shakes on the planet. “Taste testing” is one of the perks of the job in the office as scores of taste testing profiles go into creating each and every flavour.

The beauty of us as individuals is that we all have slightly different taste palettes. Some of us like curries hot, others prefer the Butter Chicken (mmm butter chicken). In the same ways, some of us like our protein drinks sweet and others not so sweet.

Our supplements cater for both individuals. It’s simple to change the way you prepare your supplement drink to cater for your palette preference.

If you would like to increase the sweetness of your supplement then decrease the amount of liquid that you add to your shaker and vice versa if you would like to decrease the sweetness of your shake.

All of our supplements are formulated to be mixed according to the prescribed directions on the nutritional information on the pack. So for 90% of customers this would be the best way to mix their drink. However, 10% of those that find the resultant drink from the prescribed mixing ratio too sweet or not sweet enough can adjust the amount of liquid.

---

### FAQ

---

#### Why don’t you use thickeners?

Our commitment to 100% purity, means that we do not use thickeners in our protein shakes. Whilst many American and European products still use thickeners to enhance the flavour profile.

---

#### Why don’t you use Stevia for all of your protein shakes?

Stevia is a natural sweetener that ONLY works when used with a mask. The mask is typically a sugar (sucrose, erythritol etc.). Without this mask it leaves a licorice bitter taste in your mouth. Because of this, Stevia is not a good sweetener to be used with protein powder unless you are willing to add a sugar to mask it. If you are consuming a protein powder sweetened by Stevia that does not have an aftertaste and also does not contain any added sugars, we would be highly dubious of the ingredient list on the product. Coca Cola – One of the biggest companies in the food industry are offering a $1M prize to any food scientist that can come up with a natural sweetener to replace Stevia as Stevia is simply not the answer to the food industries requirements at present.

---

#### Do you use Aspartame in any of your products?

Absolutely not. Aspartame continues to be a popular sweetener in the USA (in accordance with FDA regulation) but we choose not to use Aspartame in any of our products.

---

#### Can I mix my protein shake in milk, almond milk or coconut water?

Yes without a doubt. The natural sugars in either full fat or low fat milk brings out the flavours in our proteins even more. This would not apply to our amino acids, vegan and any other acidic type flavour of shakes.

## Content

Beta Alanine is a non-essential amino acid that is made by the body. It is found in meat, poultry and fish. Beta Alanine plays an important role in the production of the protein carnosine and acts as a muscle buffer during high intensity exercise.

## What does Beta Alanine do?

The production of energy needed to power movement and exercise results in free hydrogen ions, or acid. During exercise, our muscle acid levels increase and this causes a feeling of fatigue. Our body uses Beta Alanine to make carnosine, and carnosine neutralises the acid that accumulates in muscles during exercise. Supplementing with Beta Alanine increases our bodies natural carnosine production by 80%. These increased levels of carnosine allow us to exercise at our best – in particular increasing the number of reps you are able to do near maximal effort.

## Beta Alanine or carnosine?

Given that it’s carnosine that has the neutralising effect – should you just take carnosine instead? No – supplementing with Beta Alanine does a better job at increasing carnosine levels than taking carnosine itself. This is because carnosine can’t enter the muscle cells in a great amount.

Source: [https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/beta-alanine-101#dosage](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/beta-alanine-101#dosage)

## What are the benefits?

Short, high intensity activities benefit most from supplementation. Examples include:

- Short (1-7 minutes) sustained high intensity sports (e.g. rowing, track cycling, swimming, middle distance running)
- Sports that involve repeated high intensity efforts of exercise (e.g. resistance training, team sports, racquet sports)
- Strength training – increasing the number of reps you can push out at rep ranges above 8.

Beta alanine is one of the small group of supplements that directly improve sports performance noted in the [2018 IOC Consesus statement](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/52/7/439#T3).

## Recommended dosing and potential side effects

The recommended dosage to take is 4-6g per day for up to 10 weeks. It can be taken at different times of the day to fuel carnosine production at a longer duration. Do not take before bedtime.

One serve of [VPA® Beta Alanine](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/beta-alanine) is 1.2g with each 200g tub having 166 serves. We recommend weighing each serve with microscales to obtain an accurate serving size. If you do not have microscales, one serve is around ½ of a tea spoon. Monitor your intake and cross-check nutritional labels especially if you also take pre-workouts. Our [Gold Coast Stim](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/gold-coast-stim) (formerly Pre-30 V.2) contains 1.5g beta alanine per serve while [Venom](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/venom-pre-workout) Pre-workout contains 2g per serve.

After stopping supplementation, it takes about 15 weeks for muscle carnosine levels to return to starting concentrations.

Some athletes report skin tingling (which some people like) with supplementation – but the sensation is harmless. Split dosing strategies can reduce this sensation.

## 1. Collagen Pro®

Combining the highest quality collagen hydrolysate, with pre- and probiotics, our VPA® [Collagen Pro®](/products/collagen-pro-r) is ideal for those who want to maximise their gut health. Did you know that [70% of our immune system is found in our gut](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2515351)? In other words, a healthy gut means a strong immune system, and Collagen Pro® can help you achieve gut health in three ways.

- The amino acids that make up collagen protein are [directly utilised by the gut and help keep it healthy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28174772).
- Probiotics is a fancy word for healthy bacteria. Foods which contain probiotics include yogurt, pickles, kefir, and sauerkraut. Pro-biotics can also be taken in powdered form, including in Collagen Pro®. Probiotics help populate our digestive tract with good bacteria, and this helps keep our gut healthy and our immune system strong.
- Prebiotics are what the good bacteria feed on, helping to keep the community diverse and healthy. The fibre you eat in food is a prebiotic, but they can also be taken in supplement form, such as the inulin which is included in Collagen Pro®.

Collagen also offers numerous benefits for joints, bones, tendons, ligaments, and cartilage because it is one of the main components of the various connective tissue in our body.  You could say that collagen is the glue that holds the body together. Check them out by clicking on the photo above or add them to your cart in the button below.

## If you’re on the go, or trying to refuel after a workout, protein powder can be a useful supplement. Because most protein powders are made from whey (dairy), what should you do if you’re following a plant based diet?

Plant foods like rice, soy and seeds can be turned into plant-based protein powders by removing the fat and carbs. This process “isolates” the protein from the plant food to create plant protein powder.

There are many types of vegan, or plant-based protein powders including soy, pea, rice, pumpkin seed, and Sacha Inchi. Plant-based protein powders are ideal if you are vegan or unable to consume dairy products. Anyone looking to get more protein variety in their diet can use plant protein powders. Using a plant-based protein powder with digestive enzymes will increase the amount of protein that you can absorb. Because plant proteins are not digested as quickly as whey they make a snack between meals.

---

## What is a complete protein?

All proteins, whether plant or animal are made up of chains of amino acids. Because they have all nine of the essential amino acids, animal proteins are complete proteins. Most plant proteins lack one or more of these nine building blocks. However, if you eat a range of plant foods over the day, [you will still get an adequate supply of essential amino acids](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27886704). Your liver helps by storing various essential amino acids over the course of a day for use when they are needed.

---

## Single source plant protein vs plant protein blends

Because single source plant proteins are not complete proteins, it is important to choose a plant protein blend. The best plant-based proteins will blend proteins from multiple sources providing you with all 20 amino acids. This is what makes [VPA® Premium Plant](/products/premium-plant-vegan-protein) vegan protein the best protein powder if you are following a plant-based diet. Not only is it nutritious but it exceptional value for money. VPA® Premium Plant blends four different plant-based protein sources which we will discuss below.

---

### Pea protein powder

Peas are a great plant-based source of protein that helps to repair your body and build lean muscle. One cup of green peas contains around 8 grams of protein—about the same as a cup of dairy milk.

Yellow peas are the source of [pea protein isolate](/products/pea-protein-isolate). Pea plant powder is high in essential branch chain amino acids (BCAAs) – leucine, isoleucine and valine. [These 3 BCAAs are important for building muscle protein](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25628520). In one study of 161 young males supplementation with pea protein after strength training led to a 20% increase in muscle thickness. This was the same result as achieved by the group consuming whey protein.

---

### Rice protein powder

Brown rice is the source of rice protein powder. The rice protein is separated from the carbohydrates by treating it with enzymes. While rice protein is high in cysteine and methionine amino acids, it is lower in lysine than pea protein. Therefore, a combination of pea and rice protein makes for a more complete protein combination.

---

### Pumpkin seed protein powder

Pumpkin seeds (pepitas) are cold pressed to produce pumpkin seed protein. It is an animal free, high-quality protein source. It is rich in nutrients and the amino acids necessary for recovery and optimal health.

---

### Sacha Inchi plant protein powder

Sasha Inchi, (plukenetia) is a Amazon rainforest vine with high protein seeds. Sasha Inchi contains all of the essential amino acids, making it a complete protein source. What makes Sacha Inchi protein so special is that it is one of the highest digestible plant proteins. Furthermore, Sacha Inchi also contains very high levels of omega-3.

---

## Plant protein with digestive enzymes

Plant-based protein powders have a much lower bio-availability than whey proteins. This means that they are not as easily digested or absorbed and this could result in not being able to make use of the full serve of protein. The best plant-based protein powders have added digestive enzymes to maximise your uptake of protein. This is what makes [VPA® Premium Plant](/products/premium-plant-vegan-protein) one of the highest quality plant proteins on the market.

**SEO Description:** Everything you need to know about egg protein powder explained. What is it, how can you use it, and what are its benefits?

### What is egg protein powder?

Whey, plant-based, collagen, and egg protein powder. Who knew that protein powders could be so diverse, and that choosing one could be so difficult? One of the most overlooked and undervalued protein powders is egg protein powder. Below we will explain what egg protein powder is, what the benefits of it are, and how it can be used.

### How do you make egg protein powder?

Egg protein powder (EWPP), is pasteurised, dried and powdered egg white protein. Egg white protein is also called albumen, and that’s why you might see egg white protein powder called albumen powder. With a high biological value, and containing vitamins and minerals EWPP is a great choice of protein powder for many people.

### What are the benefits of egg protein powder?

Egg protein powder has some benefits over fresh eggs and other types of protein powder. We will explain these benefits below and how they will help you reach your diet and body composition goals.

#### It is dairy and lactose free

Unlike whey protein which comes from cows milk, EWPP is both dairy protein and lactose free. This makes it an ideal protein choice if you have dairy allergies or lactose intolerance. It’s also a good choice if you are on a low FODMAP diet as it should not cause you digestive discomfort. Are you finding that you are not as tolerant of whey protein as you used to be? This is because as we age, we can produce less lactase which is the enzyme that digests lactose.

#### It is low in carbohydrate and fat

Compared to whole eggs, egg white powder is relatively higher in protein and and lower in fat and calories. One 30g serve of EWPP has 25g of protein, 0.5g of fat, and no carbohydrate. This makes it an ideal choice for those wanting a high protein supplement without the added calories and fat.

#### It has a high bioavailability

The bioavailability score of a protein takes into account how easily the protein is digested, whether it provides the full range of amino acids, and how the protein is used. Egg white protein has a biological value of 100 which is as good as it gets in terms of protein quality, digestibility and effectiveness. EWPP is a complete protein meaning it contains all 21 amino acids that humans need. This gives it an advantage over plant-based proteins which are usually lacking some amino acids.

#### It increases lean muscle mass

Egg white powder contains high level of the amino acid Arginine which is a precursor of nitric oxide to stimulate growth hormone. It also stimulates insulin secretion and this has an anabolic effects on muscle growth. Consuming EWPP is an effective way of stimulating muscle growth and repair and can accelerate the rate at which muscle is gained.

#### It improves muscle recovery

Egg white powder contains high amounts of Branched Chain Amino Acids (BCAA) and these are useful in supporting muscle recovery. Leucine in the BCAA promotes rapid muscle recovery from exercise via anabolic muscle building effects.

#### It is a moderate acting protein

Egg white powder is slower to digest than WPI, but faster than casein. This makes it a useful protein to include in meals to promote muscle growth, but also keep you feeling satisfied.

#### It is safe and shelf-stable

Fresh eggs sometimes carry pathogens such as salmonella which can cause food poisoning and make you sick. During manufacturing, the egg whites are pasteurised and this removes any pathogens that may have been present. In powdered form, EWPP does not need to be kept chilled to stay fresh like fresh eggs and egg whites do. This makes it a handy protein source to have on hand to whip up a high protein snack or meal.

### How do you use egg protein powder?

Egg protein powder is a natural, unflavoured product and is considered to have a harsh taste. EWPP tends to foam when mixed in water so most people don’t use it in a shake like whey protein. The most common uses of EWPP are for cooking and use in savory dishes such as omlettes and baking. EWPP is ideal to blend in with whole eggs to make a higher protein omelette, or to mix with water to make an egg white omelette. Use salt, pepper and spices to add flavour, and boost the nutritional value by adding vegetables and making a complete meal of it.

Hopefully we’ve explained why EWPP is a useful protein supplement and why need it in your stack. You can find our [Egg Protein Powder here](/products/egg-protein), and if you purchase more than one we offer you a discount. What’s not to love about that?

Almost every triathlete is looking for the next strategy they can use to get an edge for a competition or to improve their performance. And while supplements certainly are not the laying foundation for great performance, optimizing your supplement routine can help take your performance to the next level.

## Caffeine

Caffeine is [well-known to be a performance booster](https://idealnutrition.com.au/the-low-down-on-caffeine-and-sports-performance/) for endurance events. The biggest benefit that people notice is that it reduces the rate of perceived effort. It makes things feel easier.

But more importantly, it can improve your record times. A meta-analysis that included the majority of the research on caffeine and endurance performance highlighted that it [improved performance by an average of 2.2%](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29876876/).

Reducing your triathlon time by 1-3% is a pretty big deal for something as simple as consuming caffeine, and most people are willing to put in a lot more work for fewer results.

From another perspective, caffeine is a gastrointestinal stimulant. This is not relevant for everybody. But if it causes any gastrointestinal distress that noticeably impacts your performance, it is worthwhile weighing up the pros and cons. If that gastrointestinal distress impacts your performance negatively, it could outweigh the 1-3% boost caffeine provides.

Dosage: 1-3mg/kg of body weight, 30 minutes before the race. Going up to as high as 6mg/kg can be an option as well.

One of the more recent supplements that have burst onto the radar of triathletes looking to improve their performance is [beetroot juice](https://idealnutrition.com.au/beetroot-juice-endurance/). The way beetroot juice works is through the effects of nitrates.

Nitrates are typically found in vegetables and they mainly act by vasodilation and improved blood flow. This results in increased efficiency and [improved time to exhaustion](http://sshs.exeter.ac.uk/news/research/title_37371_en.html).

In terms of performance, this improved blood flow translates to an [average reduction in race times of around the 1.5% mark](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5295087/).

Dosage: 5-7mmol of nitrate around 3hrs before training.

The effects typically take 30 minutes to be noticeable, [peak after 90 minutes, and last for 6-8hrs](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/hypertensionaha.107.103523?ijkey=5ec725973d624beded6be2d3792e3ed9a10b09d2).

It is also worth noting that [taking beetroot juice daily for 3-4 days improves its effectiveness](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpregu.00206.2010) even more than acute dosage, so arguably it would make sense to do that instead of just a once-off dose. The effects seem to plateau after about 6 days.

The final thing to be aware of is that you must not brush your teeth or use mouthwash right after taking beetroot juice as it can block the conversion of nitrates into nitrites, which also blocks the effectiveness of the supplement.

## What is ZMA6 Recovery?

There’s a new kid on the block that’s going to take your recovery to the next level and it is **ZMA6 Recovery**. If you’ve never heard of ZMA before, then you’re in for a treat because you’re about to learn what it is and why you should be using it.

As a sports nutritionist, I’m always looking at the best ways to recover from my workouts, have a good night's sleep, and wake up feeling refreshed. A few years ago, after doing some research on supplements I stumbled across the ZMA formula which is Zinc, Magnesium, and Vitamin B6.

After purchasing this supplement and taking it the first night, I had quite vivid dreams which I don’t often get and having vivid dreams is a great sign that you’re getting good sleep. I also woke up that morning feeling quite refreshed and from there I knew that this would be a useful tool in my toolbelt.

Now here’s the thing, the best way for you to recover from training isn’t foam rolling or stretching or sitting around on the couch after a workout, it’s actually your nutrition and your sleep.

When you sleep, that is when your body has the best time to recover, heal, and adapt to the demands you’ve placed on it so you want to make sure you’re getting the most restorative sleep possible. This is where ZMA plays such an important role.

ZMA is a supplement which is the nutrition side of things that also helps you with your sleep which means it’s covering both bases for recovery.

---

- **Zinc:** This trace mineral is necessary for more than 300 enzymes involved in metabolism, digestion, immunity, and other areas of your health. It helps the immune system fight off invading bacteria and viruses. The body also needs zinc to make proteins and DNA, the genetic material in all cells.
- **Vitamin B6**: This water-soluble vitamin is needed for processes such as making neurotransmitters and nutrient metabolism.

---

- **Magnesium:** Magnesium is a nutrient that the body needs to stay healthy. Magnesium is important for many processes in the body, including regulating muscle and nerve function, blood sugar levels, and blood pressure and making protein, bone, and DNA.
- **Ashwagandha:** Ashwagandha contains chemicals that could help calm the brain, reduce swelling (inflammation), lower blood pressure, and alter the immune system. So, a reduction is stress is crucial for recovery.
- **L**-**tryptophan:** This is an essential amino acid that helps the body make proteins and certain brain-signaling chemicals. Your body changes **L**-**tryptophan** into a brain chemical called serotonin. Serotonin helps control your mood and sleep.
- **L-glutamine:** **This is also an amino acid and** is an energy source for intestinal and immune cells. It also helps maintain the barrier between the intestines and the rest of your body and aids with proper growth of intestinal cells, which means it’s great for your stomach health.
- **Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA):** GABA is a natural brain relaxant that makes us feel good. GABA works by blocking brain signals (neurotransmissions). **GABA** helps the body and mind to relax and fall asleep, and to sleep well throughout the night.

With all the ingredients listed on VPA ZMA6 Recovery, you can see why this product is a fantastic supplement to take especially if you’re looking to optimize your recovery.

### Whey Protein Isolate or Whey Protein Concentrate

Anyone remember newbie gains? I do, fondly. That period of time when you first start strength training when gains seem to come quickly and easily as a result of simply turning up to the gym. But alas, the newbie gain train eventually comes to an end, and we are faced with putting hard and consistent work over a long period of time to add kilos to our lifts. I’m not even going to tell you the embarrassing amount of time it’s taken me to add a measly 2.5kg to my benchpress. (As a side note, have you ever noticed how many people quit strength sports when newbie gains end?) Other than smart programming, progressive overload, good nutrition and rest and recovery, there are three supplements that all serious strength athletes should be taking.

![Whey Protein](https://i.shgcdn.com/87f43551-52ca-480d-9af5-b18d34a16d45/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

Both **[WPI](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder)** and **[WPC](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/premium-whey-wpc)** are proteins derived from cows milk. They differ only in the number of times they have been filtered, with the extra filtering of WPI resulting in a higher protein, lower carbohydrate and fat protein powder than WPC. WPI and WPC provide the amino acid building blocks we need to build more muscle. Whey protein contains all 9 essential amino acids, including high levels of the amino acid leucine, which has been shown to effectively trigger and stimulate muscle protein synthesis.

A daily dose of at least 1.6g of protein per kg of body weight a day is optimal for increasing muscle size and strength. If possible, protein intake should be timed around training. As far as high quality, and convenience options WPI and WPC are ideal protein sources to help strength athletes progress in their training.

## Over the past few years, with protein intake gaining significant emphasis, protein water has gained considerable attention. Protein water may fit nicely into your health and fitness routine as a convenient and versatile nutritional product. This article explores this innovative beverage's benefits, uses, and insights while addressing common questions and concerns.

### What Is Protein Water?
Let’s begin with the basics. What is protein water? Protein water is precisely what it sounds like. It provides the same benefits as any other bottled water while also packing in a healthy dose of protein, which can benefit those looking to get healthier.

It is a flavoured water beverage, typically derived from whey and collagen, that provides the drinker with health benefits. Protein water comes in various flavours and tastes, just like your favourite flavoured drinks. Compared to other protein supplements like [Whey Protein Isolate](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder) and Whey Protein Concentrate, which have a milky consistency, protein water has the consistency of- well, water. It is not completely clear but less cloudy than typical protein powders.

The best part about it is that while it supplies you with the needed protein your body craves, it also provides excellent taste. If you are trying to get more muscle and less fat, this is the drink because the extra protein will help you build lean muscle mass instead of flabby fat. The reason? Most protein water products contain 15 to 20 grams of protein per serving, alongside significantly less sugar and carbs. Consequently, this makes it a popular option for individuals looking to increase their protein intake without adding excessive calories.

It’s refreshing and designed to provide essential amino acids that support muscle recovery, hydration, and overall health.

### Why Is Protein Water Popular?
Protein water is popular because people are becoming more health-conscious and consuming more protein than before. We live in a culture that loves convenience, and protein water fits right into this category.

You can find this drink at virtually any store that sells beverages, which makes it even more convenient to purchase at any time of day or night when you're craving some extra nutrients or energy during your workout session or meal.

### Key Benefits of Protein Water
#### Enhanced Hydration and Absorption
Protein water is the perfect combo, delivering hydration with protein intake. Helping replenish fluids and essential nutrients post-workout, its liquid form supports quicker absorption, supporting faster muscle repair and recovery.

#### Convenience on-the-go
As discussed above, protein water offers a portable, time-saving way to meet daily protein needs. Whether consumed while rushing to the office or during or after workouts, it provides a hassle-free solution to maintaining a balanced diet.

#### Digestive Ease
Compared to other protein supplements, protein water is easier on the gut. The absence of heavy ingredients like cream or milk lactose makes it suitable for individuals with sensitive digestion.

Supports Lean Muscle Building, Muscle Recovery, and Maintenance

Protein helps repair and build lean muscle mass, but getting enough protein through your diet is not always easy. Protein water is an easy way to improve your diet and ensure you get the nutrients needed to stay healthy.

Staying active is essential as you age so your muscles don't become weak and flabby. Regular exercise is integral to any anti-ageing skincare routine, but it's often hard for older adults to maintain their activity level. Protein water can help keep your muscles strong even if you have trouble staying active.

#### Low-Calorie and Low-Sugar Options
For those aiming to reduce calorie intake without sacrificing protein consumption, protein water options like VPA’s [Protein Water](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/protein-water) provide an effective solution. Its low-sugar profile is best for individuals controlling their sugar intake.

#### Versatility in Usage
Protein water isn’t just limited to the typical gym-goer. It can be incorporated into various lifestyles, from supporting weight loss goals to supplementing protein intake for older, less-active adults needing additional protein.

# How important is leucine and how does it work to help you perform better during training?

---

## Content

Everyone knows that protein is an important thing to look out for in one’s diet – and especially after a workout.

It is responsible for restoring muscle tissues after exercise and plays a minor role in producing energy under more extreme training. It helps increase the impact of your workout, making it even more effective when mixed with carbohydrates to absorb the protein and turn it into more muscle growth. The complete proteins we consume found in the likes of meat, fish, dairy, and eggs are made up of the same amino acids that fuel our muscle growth. One of these amino acids is Leucine, one out of nine *essential* amino acids.

“Essential” means it cannot be created by the body and is considered a key stimulator of protein synthesis, making it the best compared to any other amino acid. Leucine is often called the ['King of Aminos'](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/leucine-the-king-of-the-amino-acids) for this reason.

---

### How Leucine works in the body

Taking Leucine supplements can regulate several cellular processes, such as tissue regeneration and metabolism. Leucine may help in healing the skin and bones as well as increase muscle growth and lean body mass which is great after a full-on workout. Paired with consistent training, flicking on the leucine switch will help you to see improvement in muscle growth.

---

A [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16507602/) took place at the University of Texas in Galveston aiming to see just how effective leucine intake can be in two different age groups. In younger participants, aged 28 to 30, changes observed in muscle protein metabolism were similar whether the amount of leucine was 26 percent or 41 percent of the total amino acids. There were also significant increases in blood levels of amino acids that occurred very rapidly.

Meanwhile, the older age group, aged 66, saw an increase in protein synthesis only with a 41 percent solution. Due to a possible decrease in sensitivity to leucine, individuals 65 years and older should aim to ingest extra leucine to activate muscle protein synthesis.

For most adults, however, the current recommendation for leucine is a minimum daily intake of 25 mg per pound (55 mg per kg) of body weight.

---

### When do you take Leucine?

It is best to take leucine 30 minutes or less after any resistance training to encourage an anabolic stimulus. Taking it a few minutes post-workout will help your body to start repairing muscles and enhance muscle protein synthesis after training.

For those looking for more dietary options containing leucine and other BCAAs, other than the powder supplement, healthy sources of amino acids may be found in foods like:

- salmon
- chickpea
- brown rice
- eggs
- soybeans
- nuts
- beef

---

### Side effects and risks of taking Leucine

Very high doses of leucine may cause low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). It may also cause pellagra. Symptoms of this can include:

- skin lesions
- hair loss
- gastrointestinal problems

People who are pregnant or breastfeeding shouldn’t use leucine supplements either. If you’re unsure whether to take any supplements, always consult your doctor.

---

### Bottomline

Amino acids, like the branch-chained Leucine, can be used by skeletal muscle to give energy during exercise. Eating foods that have complete protein gives enough of these amino acids.

Taking Leucine supplements are safe as well when used appropriately as oral supplements like those in powder form.

With so many pre-workout products on the market it can be overwhelming and difficult to know which is best and what the ingredients do.
When it comes to VPA®  VENOM®, we’ve really pushed the limits to create the ultimate pre-workout. Each ingredient has been specifically chosen for its multitude of benefits to both health and sports performance.
Let’s delve deeper into some of the powerful ingredients behind VENOM®.

### 1. Ashwagandha
Ashwagandha has been used for thousands of years to boost energy levels, improve focus, and to reduce stress and anxiety.
It also has many benefits in terms of athletic performance, as studies suggest it may help increase muscle strength and size, improve cardiorespiratory fitness, and increase endurance. Other benefits include increased reaction time and improved memory.

### 2. Siberian Ginseng
Another ingredient special to VENOM® is Siberian Ginseng. Alike ashwagandha, this shrub is an adaptogen that can help the body cope with stress, recover from strenuous exercise and boost energy levels.
Siberian ginseng has been shown to increase oxygenation of cells meaning it can assist to increase physical endurance, and even enhance concentration and memory. Traditionally this herb has also been known to strengthen the skeleton and tendons.

### 3. Taurine
Taurine is an amino acid naturally found in the human body and in food sources including meat, fish and dairy. This ingredient is an important addition to VENOM® as it has strong antioxidant properties to help maintain healthy physiological functions during exercise and to decrease muscular fatigue.
It may also support nerve growth and when combined with caffeine, taurine may improve mental performance.

### 4. Caffeine
Caffeine is by far one of the most widely used stimulants in pre-workouts and VENOM® is no exception. [Studies have shown that caffeine can increase alertness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK209050/#:~:text=In%20summary%2C%20studies%20indicate%20that,in%20moderately%20sleep%2Ddeprived%20individuals.). 
Caffeine also has a thermogenic effect meaning that it stimulates fat burning making it a perfect pre-workout addition.

### 5. Creatine Monohydrate & Arginine Alpha-Ketoglutarate (AAKG)
[Creatine](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/creatine-monohydrate) is naturally produced in the body from three amino acids: arginine, glycine and methionine. It’s then stored in and used by muscle cells to rapidly produce energy during high-intensity exercise. For this reason, creatine and AAKG supplementation is popular among athletes to improve performance, increase strength and build muscle mass. It may also improve recovery time after exercise and promote brain health.

### 6. Citrulline Malate
[Citrulline malate](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/citrulline-malate) is another common ingredient found in pre-workouts. Being a combination of citrulline and malic acid, this ingredient is more easily absorbed and used by the body compared to citrulline on its own.
Citrulline malate has been shown to increase nitric oxide (NO) levels in the body, which causes blood vessels to expand and allows more blood and nutrients to reach muscles. In doing this citrulline malate promotes better pumps, may increase endurance during resistance exercise, and reduce muscle soreness.

### 7. L-Tyrosine
L-Tyrosine is a non-essential amino acid that is used in the body to produce dopamine and norepinephrine; two neurotransmitters that influence mood and stress. For this reason, tyrosine supplementation has been shown to improve mood, cognition and focus during acute stressful situations such as high intensity exercise.

VPA® VENOM® is the ultimate pre-workout supplement that will benefit both the experienced and inexperienced workout enthusiast. Formulated with a multitude of powerful ingredients, VENOM® is designed to maximise strength, improve endurance, and enhance focus. Take your workouts to the next level and try it today.

"How do you know if you're strong enough to start competing in powerlifting? Is there are minimum standard for which you should be aiming? Some signal or light-bulb moment that makes you realise it's time to put on the soft suit and take the platform? Coach and gym owner Jacky explains when the the optimum time to start competing."

"I'm not strong enough to compete?"

I can't tell you how much it ANNOYS me when I hear people say that! Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but you will likely never be strong enough. There will always be someone out there stronger, better, more dedicated, more gifted, etc than what you are. That's the beauty of competition. But those stronger and better athletes are the ones that push YOU to become stronger and a better athlete.

And let me tell you another thing, if you wait until you are 'strong enough' you'll most likely have a pretty bittersweet experience on the platform. Competing is NOTHING like training, and your first competition may not go as well as you antocipate. In fact I like to think of your competition debut as dress rehearsal for the ones that will follow.

In my second ever Powerlifting competition in 2013, I PR'd my bench and got so excited I racked the bar before the ref made the rack call. Guess what? The lift didn't count! Comps have rules...and rules are rules!

Competing is a skill

Competing is a skill, much like strength training, and practice makes perfect. The more comps you do, the better you get at them. There are plenty of reasons to take the plunge from training into competing, and few of them relate to being the strongest, or winning the competitions.

6 reasons you should do a powerlifting competition

- It's fun!
- Like seriously...a lot of fun.
- It gives you a goal to work toward.
- It keeps you focused with training.
- It gives you an environment to push yourself to the absolute max, which can NEVER be replicated in training.
- Competitions have a great atmosphere of camaraderie, yes, even among competitors!

I LOVE COMPETING. I've competed in 11 Powerlifting comps since 2012, and a handful of Strongman comps, but have had to step back to concentrate on my second love...organising powerlifting competitions (notice a theme here?)

So what are you waiting for. Remember that:

Powerlifting is an inclusive sport

- There are no prerequisites to compete.
- There is no minimum strength standard.
- There are no age restrictions.
- There are no weight restrictions.
- There are no expectations.

Doing anything worthwhile in life generally starts by stepping out of your comfort zone. Those experiences are also often the most rewarding. So get out there, and give it a go!

## When it comes to achieving fitness goals, many people turn to supplements to support their efforts. Two popular options in the realm of fitness supplements are [creatine](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/creatine-monohydrate) and [fat burners](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/summer-fomo). In this article, we will explore the characteristics of these supplements, their effects on the body, and how they contribute to weight management. By understanding the distinctions between creatine and fat burners, you can make an informed decision about which one aligns better with your fitness objectives.

### Creatine - Enhancing Strength and Muscle Growth

Creatine is a widely used supplement known for its potential benefits in enhancing strength and promoting muscle growth. It works by increasing the production of ATP, the energy currency of our cells, leading to improved athletic performance. However, it's essential to note that Creatine does not directly burn fat or target specific areas like belly fat. Its primary focus is on improving strength and facilitating muscle development.

### Fat Burners - Aiding in Weight Loss

Fat burners, on the other hand, are specifically formulated to assist in weight loss efforts. They contain ingredients that aim to boost metabolism, increase energy expenditure, and enhance fat oxidation. Fat burners can provide a temporary increase in calorie burning and may contribute to overall weight loss when combined with a proper diet and regular exercise routine. It's crucial to understand that fat burners are not a magic solution and should be used as part of a holistic approach to weight management.

### Creatine and Fat Burners: Impact on Muscle Growth

One common concern is whether fat burners negatively affect muscle growth. While fat burners primarily target fat metabolism, they do not necessarily hinder muscle growth when used responsibly. The key lies in ensuring that you consume adequate protein and maintain an appropriate calorie intake to support muscle development. Combining a well-rounded strength training program, proper nutrition, and fat burner supplementation can help achieve a balance between fat loss and muscle growth.

## Protein Requirements

Protein; by now we all know why we need it. Protein, is not only essential for building muscle but also has a vital role in forming other physical structures such as connective tissue, and blood vessels. It addition, protein is essential to creating hormones and enzymes that are vital to essential physiological processes in our bodies. OK, so we know we need it, but that leads to the next question; just exactly how much protein is needed to stay healthy and perform at your sporting best?

### How much protein do I need?

Like most nutrition questions, the answer to this is “It depends”.

The amount of protein you need is dependent on a variety of factors including:

- Your age
- Your health status
- How active you are
- What sports you do
- What your goals are

### What are my protein requirements?

Protein needs are usually given as how many grams of protein you need to eat, per kilogram of body weight each day.

For example: The protein requirements of someone during general training is given as 1g/kg of body weight. This means, a female who weighs 60kg will need 60g of protein per, while a male who weighs 90kg needs 90g of protein per day.

**Check out the table below to see the protein requirements of different groups of people:**

### Do I need to use a protein supplement?

It’s entirely possible to hit your daily protein requirements using food alone. However, here are some reasons supplementing with protein may be beneficial and help you reach your daily protein goals:

#### High protein targets can be hard to hit

Whether you have large protein requirements because you’re a heavy strength training man, or you’re requirements aren’t that high but you find it difficult to plan your food to hit your targets, a protein shake may help get you there.

#### Whey protein stimulates muscle synthesis

Due to its high leucine content, whey protein consistently outperforms other protein sources when it comes to stimulating muscle synthesis for repair and growth.

#### It's convenient

With the convenience and portability of a protein shake, there are literally no excuses for not being able to hit daily protein targets.

## Barley Grass: A Nutrient-Rich Superfood

Barley grass, derived from the young leaves of the barley plant, has been gaining popularity as a superfood packed with essential nutrients. From boosting the immune system to supporting weight loss, this vibrant green powder offers a range of health benefits.

In this article, we will explore the benefits of barley grass and provide answers to the most-asked questions related to this nutrient-rich ingredient.

### What are the health benefits of barley grass?

Barley grass is a nutritional powerhouse, enriched with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that promote overall well-being. One can easily find these in different forms on the market such as barley grass powder, barley grass capsules, and barley grass superfood blends. Its impressive nutrient profile supports various health benefits, including:

- **Boosting the immune system:**
  Barley grass is a rich source of vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, vitamin A, vitamin K, vitamin B-complex, iron, calcium, and zinc. These nutrients are essential for the proper functioning of the immune system. For example, vitamin C is known for its antioxidant properties and its role in promoting the production and function of white blood cells, which are crucial for immune defense.

- **Detoxifying the body:**
  Barley grass acts as a natural detoxifier since it contains various antioxidants, such as flavonoids, beta-carotene, and chlorophyll, which aid in the elimination of harmful toxins and heavy metals. This, in turn, improves liver function and digestion. Antioxidants help neutralize free radicals in the body, which can cause oxidative stress and damage cells. By reducing oxidative stress, the immune system may function more effectively.

While barley grass can be a nutritious addition to a balanced diet and may offer potential health benefits, it's essential to approach the idea of "detoxification" with critical thinking. The human body is naturally equipped to handle detoxification, and no single food or supplement can magically remove toxins from the body.

So, it is good to note that one can support the body's natural detoxification processes by:

- Maintaining a healthy lifestyle that includes a balanced diet
- Regular exercise
- Adequate hydration
- Sufficient sleep

If you have specific health concerns or conditions, it's always recommended to consult with a healthcare professional before making significant changes to your diet or lifestyle.

# Benefits of L-Tyrosine for Brain Function and Mood

In today's fast-paced world, maintaining optimal brain function, managing stress, and achieving a positive mood are often top priorities. Enter l-tyrosine, an amino acid that holds immense potential for supporting these aspects of our well-being. In this article, we will explore the benefits of l-tyrosine, its impact on cognitive function, its role in managing depression and anxiety, its safety for long-term use, and the best food sources to obtain it from.

---

## Content

## What is l-tyrosine?

L-tyrosine is a naturally occurring amino acid that plays a crucial role in the production of several important neurotransmitters and hormones in the human body. It is classified as a non-essential amino acid because your body can synthesize it from another amino acid called phenylalanine. However, under certain conditions, such as stress or illness, the demand for L-tyrosine may exceed the body's ability to produce it, making it conditionally essential in some cases.

## What are the benefits of l-tyrosine?

L-tyrosine offers a wide range of benefits for our physical and mental health. By supporting the production of key neurotransmitters like dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, l-tyrosine plays a crucial role in mood regulation, stress response, and overall brain function. Additionally, l-tyrosine has been shown to enhance cognitive function, boost physical performance, support thyroid health, aid in weight management, and promote a positive mood.

### Neurotransmitter Synthesis

L-tyrosine is a precursor for several important neurotransmitters, including dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline). These neurotransmitters are involved in mood regulation, stress response, and cognitive function. Adequate L-tyrosine levels are necessary for the balanced production of these neurotransmitters.

### Thyroid Hormone Production

L-tyrosine is a key component in the synthesis of thyroid hormones, specifically thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). These hormones are essential for regulating metabolism, energy production, and overall growth and development.

### Stress Response

During periods of stress, whether physical or psychological, the demand for norepinephrine and epinephrine increases. L-tyrosine helps support the body's ability to produce these stress hormones, which are involved in the "fight or flight" response.

### Cognitive Function

Some people take L-tyrosine supplements to potentially enhance cognitive function, particularly during situations that demand focus, alertness, and mental clarity. While the evidence is mixed, some studies suggest that L-tyrosine supplementation may have cognitive-enhancing effects under certain conditions, such as fatigue or sleep deprivation.

### Depression and Mood Regulation

L-tyrosine is sometimes explored as a supplement for individuals with depression or mood disorders, as it is a precursor to dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward. However, its effectiveness in treating mood disorders is still a subject of research and debate.

### Physical Performance

L-tyrosine is sometimes included in sports supplements due to its potential to enhance physical performance and reduce perceived fatigue during strenuous exercise. It may help support mental focus and endurance in athletes.

# Benefits of L-Lysine Supplements

L-lysine, an essential amino acid, plays a vital role in protein synthesis and overall well-being. Since the body cannot produce this amino acid on its own, it must be obtained through diet or supplements. In this comprehensive article, we will explore the many benefits of L-lysine and its best food sources.

## Promotes Protein Synthesis

L-lysine is a key building block for protein synthesis, which is essential for the growth, repair, and maintenance of tissues in your body. It plays a crucial role in the production of various proteins, including enzymes, hormones, and antibodies.

## Supports Collagen Production

L-lysine is important for the synthesis of collagen, a structural protein that forms the basis for connective tissues such as skin, tendons, and cartilage. This can promote skin health and wound healing.

## Antiviral Properties

Some research suggests that L-lysine may help in the management of certain viral infections, particularly the herpes simplex virus (HSV). It is often used as a supplement to reduce the frequency and severity of cold sores and genital herpes outbreaks.

## Bone Health

L-lysine is thought to enhance calcium absorption in the intestines, which can contribute to better bone health. It may be particularly beneficial for individuals at risk of osteoporosis.

## Stress and Anxiety Management

Some studies have suggested that L-lysine supplementation may help reduce stress and anxiety by influencing serotonin receptors in the brain. However, more research is needed in this area.

## Immune Support

L-lysine is involved in the production of antibodies and immune system cells, potentially aiding in immune function.

## Arginine Antagonism

L-lysine competes with another amino acid called arginine for absorption and utilization in the body. This is significant because certain viruses, including HSV, require arginine to replicate. By increasing lysine intake, it is believed to reduce the availability of arginine, potentially inhibiting viral replication.

## Cold Sore Prevention

One of the most well-known uses of L-lysine is in preventing and reducing the frequency of cold sore outbreaks, which are often caused by HSV. Many people take L-lysine supplements or apply L-lysine creams to the affected area for this purpose.

# The Best Food Sources of L-Lysine

Incorporating L-lysine-rich foods into your diet is a great way to ensure you are getting an adequate amount of this essential amino acid. Some excellent food sources of L-lysine include lean meats like chicken and turkey, fish such as salmon and sardines, eggs, dairy products, and legumes like lentils and beans. Vegetarians and vegans can obtain L-lysine from sources like tofu, tempeh, and quinoa. By including a variety of these foods in your meals, you can support your L-lysine intake naturally.

# Possible Side Effects of L-Lysine

While L-lysine is generally safe for consumption, it's essential to be aware of potential side effects. In rare cases, high doses of L-lysine can cause gastrointestinal issues such as diarrhea and stomach cramps. Additionally, some individuals may experience allergic reactions, including swelling, itching, or difficulty breathing. If you experience any adverse effects after taking L-lysine supplements, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional.

# Strength Training Supplements

Strength training remains a cornerstone of physical development, promoting muscular hypertrophy (growth), improved bone density, and enhanced metabolic health. However, maximising strength gains and achieving personal records (PRs) often requires a multifaceted approach, encompassing not just optimised training routines but also strategic dietary practices and potentially beneficial supplementation. This article discusses the potential benefits of various supplements commonly used by strength training athletes to support their pursuit of new PRs.

---

## 1. Protein Powder

Protein serves as the building block of muscle tissue. After an intense workout, your body craves protein to repair and rebuild those microscopic tears you create by lifting heavy things (that's a good thing!). While a balanced diet rich in whole foods like lean meats, fish, and legumes can provide sufficient protein for most individuals, athletes with demanding training programs may struggle to meet their elevated protein requirements.

Protein powder offers a convenient and concentrated source of protein, facilitating the daily intake necessary for muscle repair and growth. Research suggests a daily protein intake of 1.6-2.2 grams per kilogram of body weight may be optimal for maximising muscle protein synthesis (MPS) during resistance training. Whey protein, a fast-digesting protein source, is particularly popular due to its rapid absorption rate, potentially leading to a more pronounced MPS response.

---

## 2. Creatine

Creatine monohydrate is arguably the most well-researched and effective strength training supplement. It plays a crucial role in cellular energy production, particularly during high-intensity exercise and those explosive lifts. By supplementing creatine, athletes can enhance their intramuscular creatine stores, leading to increased availability of phosphocreatine, a high-energy molecule your body taps into for short bursts of power. Studies consistently show that creatine supplementation can improve maximal strength, power output, and work capacity, giving you that extra oomph to push through plateaus.

## 3. Beta Alanine

Beta-alanine is a non-essential amino acid that helps create carnosine, a molecule in your muscles that buffers lactic acid. Lactic acid build-up can lead to muscle fatigue and hinder your performance during high-intensity workouts. Beta-alanine supplementation increases carnosine levels in your muscles, potentially delaying fatigue and allowing you to train harder and longer, ultimately promoting strength gains. However, beta-alanine supplementation may cause a tingling sensation (paresthesia), a harmless but potentially bothersome side effect. Don't worry, it usually fades over time.

## Content

### If you’re in the market for whey protein, you've likely come across whey protein concentrate (WPC) and whey protein isolate (WPI). But what’s the difference, and which one best suits your goals? This blog will explain the difference between WPI vs WPC so that you can choose the best protein for you.

Protein is perhaps the most important supplement for fitness enthusiasts, bodybuilders, and athletes looking to have more control over their diet. It is a necessity for individuals looking to get fitter, healthier, or stronger. While protein powders may come from a variety of sources, the most effective protein powders are dairy and whey protein powders. Whey protein comes in two main forms, whey protein concentrate ([WPC](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/premium-whey-wpc)) and whey protein isolate ([WPI](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder)). Before we delve into the differences between the two, let’s examine what protein supplements are and where they come from.

## What Are Protein Supplements?

Protein supplements are dietary supplements used to meet daily nutritional requirements, especially when these goals are difficult to achieve through diet alone. These supplements typically come in powder form and can be used to improve athletic performance, enable muscle repair, and build muscle mass. Whey protein, specifically, is known for its rapid absorption and complete amino acid profile, making it an ideal choice for muscle recovery and growth. But when it comes to choosing whey protein, it’s important to understand the differences in WPI vs WPC protein. Let’s start by understanding what whey protein is.

## What is Whey Protein?

Whey protein is the powdered by-product of milk and cheese-making. So, the next time you spot those bottles of milk and blocks of cheese at the supermarket, remember that whey protein is what’s left over once the whey is separated from the milk. You can find a more detailed discussion about whey protein [here](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/supplements/everything-you-need-to-know-about-whey-protein).

## WPI vs WPC – What’s the difference?

| Aspect | WPC | WPI |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Production process | Less processed: Retains fats and carbs | More processed: Fats and carbs removed |
| Nutritional profile | Approx 75-80% protein, 4-7% fat, relatively high lactose content | Approx. 90% protein content, low-fat, low-carb, low-lactose |
| Biological and nutritional benefits | Contains amino acids, ideal high-protein snack | High in BCAAs, ideal for muscle recovery and growth |
| Digestibility and absorption | Slower digestion and absorption | Rapid digestion and absorption |
| Usage scenarios | Gain muscle mass, ideal if you want to feel full for longer | Gain lean muscle, ideal for a low-calorie diet |
| Cost-effectiveness and value | Less expensive | Slightly more expensive due to more processing, but contains more protein per serve |
| Suitability for different diets | Suitable for most diets | Suitable for lactose-intolerant diet |
| Potential allergens and intolerances | Contains lactose | Minimal lactose, better for lactose-intolerant people |
| Taste, flavour and solubility | Creamier and richer taste, thicker consistency | Mild flavour, thinner consistency and easily soluble |

### The Production Process

During production, WPI vs WPC are differentiated by their filtration levels: WPC is microfiltered once, while WPI is filtered a second time. This second filtration further removes fats and carbohydrates from the original product, producing a more refined protein. This process means that WPI is a more pure whey protein than WPC.

### Nutritional Profile

Due to being more highly refined, WPI has a higher protein, lower fat, and lower carbohydrate percentage compared to WPC. Good quality WPI vs WPC percentages are around 90% protein for WPI and about 75-80% for WPC. VPA® pure whey protein concentrate has 23g of protein per serve, 0.7g of fat and 1.5g of sugars from lactose. VPA® Whey protein isolate has 26g of protein per serve, 0.3g of fat, and only 0.3g of sugar.

## Content

## For athletes and fitness enthusiasts, adding [pre-workout supplements](https://www.vpa.com.au/collections/pre-workout-supplements) to maximise training efforts makes a significant difference. However, for most gym-goers, choosing between a stim and a non-stim pre-workout will always be a dilemma.

Should you go for that powerful energy boost of a caffeine-stoked stim, or opt for a cleaner, crash-free experience of a non-stim pre-workout?

In this guide, we'll compare both options so you can choose what works best for your body, lifestyle, and fitness goals.

## What Is a Stimulant Pre-Workout?

A stimulant pre-workout is a supplement designed to enhance your energy, focus, and performance by stimulating the central nervous system. These products are beneficial for high-intensity training, those early morning sessions when your body refuses to get out of bed, or when you're feeling lethargic.

### What Is a Stimulant Pre-Workout?

A high-stim pre-workout contains the following ingredients:

- Caffeine – The most common pre-workout stimulant. It helps increase energy, alertness, and athletic performance.
- Beta Alanine – Beta Alanine helps train for longer durations by buffering lactic acid to delay fatigue.
- Creatine and Caffeine – A potent combo. While the caffeine improves immediate performance for power output, creatine supports muscle recovery over time.
- Citrulline Malate – An amino acid found in watermelon, L-citrulline improves blood flow and oxygen delivery to muscles.

### Main Benefits

- Rapid energy boost
- Improved focus and mental clarity
- Enhanced endurance and performance

### Potential Drawbacks

- Can cause jitteriness or anxiety
- May interfere with sleep if taken late
- Tolerance, specifically caffeine tolerance, builds up over time, requiring higher doses that may harm the body in the long run.

## What Is a Non-Stimulant (Non-Stim) Pre-Workout?

A non-stim pre-workout contains no caffeine or other central nervous system stimulants. Instead, it relies on other effective ingredients to enhance performance without the energy crash.

### Key Ingredients

- Citrulline Malate – Promotes blood flow for better pumps.
- Beta Alanine – Delays fatigue by buffering acid buildup.
- Pure Creatine Monohydrate Powder – Improves strength and endurance.

### Main Benefits - What Does a Non-Stim Pre-Workout Do?

- No energy crashes or jitters
- Ideal for late-day workouts
- Supports endurance, blood flow, and strength without over-stimulation

### Who It's Great For

- Evening or night-time trainers, for whom caffeine intake during the late hours is not a good option.
- People sensitive to caffeine
- Those who want to cycle off caffeine or want to avoid tolerance buildup

## Stim vs Non-Stim Pre-Workout: Key Differences

Here's a simple breakdown to help you compare:

| FEATURE          | STIM PRE-WORKOUT          | NON-STIM PRE-WORKOUT          |
|------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Energy Boost     | High                      | Mild                          |
| Focus & Alertness| Enhanced via stimulants    | Achieved via nootropics and nitric acid boosters |
| Crash Risk       | Possible                  | None                          |
| Workout Timing   | Best in AM due to caffeine content | AM or PM safe               |
