## Five supplements to boost your F45 Results

---

### Venom® Pre-workout

[VPA® Venom® Pre-workout](/products/venom-pre-workout) is packed with Caffeine, Citrulline Malate, Creatine, Taurine, Ashwagandha Extract, and AAKG. This fiery combination is the perfect start to your 45-minute sweat session. If you are looking to increase aerobic performance, training volume, and the maintenance of lean mass, then look no further. With the ingestion of Venom® Pre-Workout 20 minutes prior to an F45 session, these results are viable.

VPA® Venom® Pre-workout contains 300mg of caffeine which not only acts as a stimulant but also reduces feelings of fatigue and increases time to exhaustion. This means you can get through that Monday morning session without feeling like that box jump is going to take you out. Taurine, an amino acid, is also contained in this pre-workout, and when ingested as a supplement effectively decreases Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS) after high-intensity concentrations. Meaning you can give your F45 sesh the intensity it deserves without the fear of waking up tomorrow in pain!
