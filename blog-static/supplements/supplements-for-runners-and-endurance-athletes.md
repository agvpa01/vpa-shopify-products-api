### Protein powder for endurance athletes

Protein powder supplements are not just for strength athletes or body builders. 10-20% of endurance athletes don’t meet their daily protein requirements. Protein provides the amino acids that fuel recovery and repair. Not eating enough protein may result in increased injury risk.

Recreational endurance athletes [require at least 1.65 g protein per kg of body per day.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6839090/) This intake optimises recovery and reduces chance of injury. Protein requirements are even higher in trail runners due to the extra wear and tear put on muscles and joints due to steep ascents, decents, and the uneven nature of the ground.

Protein is found in fresh foods including meat, dairy, legumes and lentils. However, endurance training requires a huge amount of time commitment. If you are juggling training around work and family, you may put nutrition on the back-burner. This is why a high quality pure protein supplement can benefit you.
