### Benefits that pre-workouts can provide and why

- Caffeine is contained in most pre-workout supplements deliver an energy boost, helping workout intensity and workouts last longer.
- Ingredients such as beta-alanine help to improve the explosiveness of repetitions and overall increase in exercise performance.
- Vascularity can be increased from improved blood flow granted from caffeine (faster heart beat) and also more directly from substances that have main roles of making the ‘pump’ greater (below). This is because altering the pumped up sensation when training is achieved by manipulating blood flow and visually this can have changes as the veins have to adapt as well, they go hand in hand.
- L-Citrulline is converted to L-arginine by the kidneys, another amino acid which increases the production of nitric oxide in a bid to increase nitric oxide. This allows the arteries to relax and increase blood flow throughout the body resulting in greater muscle pumps to be achieved, as more blood, oxygen and nutrients are able to enter working muscle groups. L-Citrulline has also been shown to improve overall athletic performance in healthy individuals.

**Negatives of pre workouts:**
- Constant use of caffeine can produce a type of dependency for the body if consumed consistently. Similar to your daily coffee, one should be careful of producing a habit and not feel the need to use a pre workout for every single workout if they participate in training most days of the week.
- New pre workouts are released constantly by new companies and one should hesitate and learn more about what is contained in each one before consuming. It is recommended to be inclined to purchase supplements produced by proven and trusted companies, but even then you should familiarise yourself with the ingredients and check to see if the pre workout is approved by a governing body to ensure it is safe and legal for competition sports.

**When to use/Best implementation:**
Pre-workouts give a burst of ‘energy’ soon after being consumed. While it depends on how much food the user has eaten prior etc. it still will make the person feel the effects of the certain ingredients within 20 minutes, this is also altered by the amount consumed of the product.

**Which should you buy?**
Pre-workouts are one of the most popular supplements on the market, only probably surpassed in sales by things such as whey protein. Pre-workouts may even continue to grow as people enjoy the feeling of having all the extra energy to make the workout more intense than usual. As mentioned earlier many companies are launching pre-workouts with stronger and stronger formulas, and as a result we are finding many formulas are found to have high-risk ingredients which are banned in competitive sport. So it is very important that you find a pre-workout that is developed and blended by a brand that ensures all of their products are compliant with ASADA/WADA, to reduce the chance of cross-contamination.

The best recommendation with this knowledge is to go to a trusted brand, that doesn’t add in more and more rarely seen ingredients just to try and achieve something new or push the boundaries. This is why we recommend using VPA® The benefits of [Gold Coast Stim](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/gold-coast-stim-pre-workout/) (formerly Pre-30 V.2), since all of our products are 100% ASADA/WADA compliant and safe for consumption, but still deliver the full-energy and performance boosting benefits you need in a pre-workout.
