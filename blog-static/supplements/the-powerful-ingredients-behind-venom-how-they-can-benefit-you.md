With so many pre-workout products on the market it can be overwhelming and difficult to know which is best and what the ingredients do.
When it comes to VPA®  VENOM®, we’ve really pushed the limits to create the ultimate pre-workout. Each ingredient has been specifically chosen for its multitude of benefits to both health and sports performance.
Let’s delve deeper into some of the powerful ingredients behind VENOM®.

### 1. Ashwagandha
Ashwagandha has been used for thousands of years to boost energy levels, improve focus, and to reduce stress and anxiety.
It also has many benefits in terms of athletic performance, as studies suggest it may help increase muscle strength and size, improve cardiorespiratory fitness, and increase endurance. Other benefits include increased reaction time and improved memory.

### 2. Siberian Ginseng
Another ingredient special to VENOM® is Siberian Ginseng. Alike ashwagandha, this shrub is an adaptogen that can help the body cope with stress, recover from strenuous exercise and boost energy levels.
Siberian ginseng has been shown to increase oxygenation of cells meaning it can assist to increase physical endurance, and even enhance concentration and memory. Traditionally this herb has also been known to strengthen the skeleton and tendons.

### 3. Taurine
Taurine is an amino acid naturally found in the human body and in food sources including meat, fish and dairy. This ingredient is an important addition to VENOM® as it has strong antioxidant properties to help maintain healthy physiological functions during exercise and to decrease muscular fatigue.
It may also support nerve growth and when combined with caffeine, taurine may improve mental performance.

### 4. Caffeine
Caffeine is by far one of the most widely used stimulants in pre-workouts and VENOM® is no exception. [Studies have shown that caffeine can increase alertness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK209050/#:~:text=In%20summary%2C%20studies%20indicate%20that,in%20moderately%20sleep%2Ddeprived%20individuals.). 
Caffeine also has a thermogenic effect meaning that it stimulates fat burning making it a perfect pre-workout addition.

### 5. Creatine Monohydrate & Arginine Alpha-Ketoglutarate (AAKG)
[Creatine](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/creatine-monohydrate) is naturally produced in the body from three amino acids: arginine, glycine and methionine. It’s then stored in and used by muscle cells to rapidly produce energy during high-intensity exercise. For this reason, creatine and AAKG supplementation is popular among athletes to improve performance, increase strength and build muscle mass. It may also improve recovery time after exercise and promote brain health.

### 6. Citrulline Malate
[Citrulline malate](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/citrulline-malate) is another common ingredient found in pre-workouts. Being a combination of citrulline and malic acid, this ingredient is more easily absorbed and used by the body compared to citrulline on its own.
Citrulline malate has been shown to increase nitric oxide (NO) levels in the body, which causes blood vessels to expand and allows more blood and nutrients to reach muscles. In doing this citrulline malate promotes better pumps, may increase endurance during resistance exercise, and reduce muscle soreness.

### 7. L-Tyrosine
L-Tyrosine is a non-essential amino acid that is used in the body to produce dopamine and norepinephrine; two neurotransmitters that influence mood and stress. For this reason, tyrosine supplementation has been shown to improve mood, cognition and focus during acute stressful situations such as high intensity exercise.

VPA® VENOM® is the ultimate pre-workout supplement that will benefit both the experienced and inexperienced workout enthusiast. Formulated with a multitude of powerful ingredients, VENOM® is designed to maximise strength, improve endurance, and enhance focus. Take your workouts to the next level and try it today.
