There are a tonne of different fat burners on the market, this can lead to a lot of confusion when trying to decide which fat burner is best for you, and if they even work at all. This blog will help explain what fat burners are and whether or not it taking one will help your progress towards becoming leaner.

## So, what are fat burners?

Fat burning supplements are blends of compounds that work in multiple ways to help speed up fat loss. Depending on their ingredients, they may speed your metabolism, promote fat burning, boost energy and control your hunger. The best fat burning supplements will perform more than one of these actions. They may improve your bodies ability to burn its own fat, therefore accelerating fat loss. 

Fat burners are available in both powder or capsule form. Powders are usually more useful and versatile, as they contain higher amounts of the active ingredients, and you are more easily able to adjust the dose to meet your needs. This is important as we all have a different tolerance to stimulants, and may need to adjust our intake depending on the time of day fat burner is being used.

## What do fat burners do?

Fat burner supplements act through multiple pathways to assist in the fat loss process. They are designed to be used along side your regular diet and exercise regime to accelerate fat loss. Keep in mind that if you don’t have your diet under control, no fat burning product is going to be able to help you lean out.

## Fat burners may increase metabolic rate

Many fat burner supplements contain thermogenic ingredients. This is why fat burners are sometimes referred to as “thermogenics”. Thermogenic ingredients work to increase your metabolic rate. An increase in metabolic rate means that you burn more energy, and this in turn can increase the rate at which you burn your own body fat. Common thermogenic ingredients include caffeine, green tea, and compounds derived from chili and pepper etc.

## Fat burners may increase the rate at which you burn fat

Many fat burners include ingredients such as L-carnitine which can increase the rate at which you are able to burn fat. L-carnitine plays a vital role in transporting fatty acids into our cells mitochondria, where they are oxidised to produce energy.

## Fat burners increase your mental arousal

Nearly all fat burner supplements will contain one or more stimulants which increase alertness and improve cognition. This helps you train harder, and burn more energy. In sports science, stimulants are said to “decrease the rate of perceived exertion”. This means your training feels easier, which allows you to then push to a new level of speed or strength to get more out of your workout.

## Do fat burners work?

We know you are wondering, do fat burners actually work? Should I use a fat burner? The evidence surrounding the effectiveness of fat burning supplements is mixed.

Fat burners are not a miracle supplement. We all know that you can’t out train a bad diet, right? Well similarly, you can’t “out fat burn” a poor diet and minimal training regime. However, for those that already have their diet under control by eating at a calorie deficit, or those that are already at a lower body fat percentage, a fat burner may accelerate the fat loss process or help move those last few stubborn kilos.
