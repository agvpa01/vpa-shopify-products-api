### What does protein do? Why does my body need protein?

As should be done every day, eating a healthy diet regularly and building up your defenses from the inside should be a must during this [coronavirus (COVID-19)](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/australia/) global pandemic. Good nutrition is crucial for health especially in times when the immune system needs to be in its best shape. While keeping a balanced diet is important, let’s focus on the **health benefits of protein**.

Protein is an important macronutrient that plays a major role in the entire body. It’s responsible for **building hormones and enzymes** in our body while helping us keep our **muscles, bones, blood, hair and nails healthy**.

Protein helps **build and repair muscle** to give you **strength and mobility** and increase **fat burning**. It maintains and **repairs tissues** helping to heal wounds and keep organs healthy. Protein is also responsible for making antibodies that **optimize the immune system**, helping to fight infections and diseases.

### What are examples of protein-rich foods?

While limited access to fresh foods may seem like a roadblock to eating healthy these days, that’s not the case! Stocking on protein-rich foods may be easier than you think once you breeze through our list below.

*Note: Must be refrigerated.*

### Seafood

Seafood is an excellent source of essential nutrients including immunity supporting zinc and magnesium. It is high in protein and often low in fat. Fish such as salmon is a little higher in fat, but it is the heart-healthy kind: it has omega-3 fatty acids.

### White-Meat Poultry

White meat poultry is an excellent source of lean protein, especially chicken breast. Dark meat is a little higher in fat.

### Lean Red-Meats

Red meats are a good source of high-quality protein provided that the options are lean, like lean beef or pork tenderloin cuts.

### Eggs

Eggs are an excellent source of protein, nutrients, and healthful fats. While whole eggs are high in protein, it’s good to note that eating just the egg whites is almost pure protein. Eggs and food containing eggs are not suitable for people with an egg allergy.

An alternative to fresh eggs is our [VPA® Egg Protein](/products/egg-protein). Not only is egg protein powder perfect for those with dairy allergies and are lactose intolerant, it contains complete protein with all 9 essential amino acids and is low in fats and carbohydrates.

### Milk, Cottage cheese and Yogurt

Dairy products are excellent sources of protein and calcium to keep bones and teeth strong. They are also good sources of probiotics, which are good bacteria that can help promote a healthy gut and immune system.

Probiotics are also found to be effective for fighting the common cold and influenza-like respiratory infections. For those on a dairy-free diet or who are lactose intolerant, we suggest the [plant-based milk](/products/premium-plant-vegan-protein) soy milk which is also high in protein. Note that almond milk, other nut milks, and coconut milk are not suitable high protein milk alternatives.

### Protein on-the-go

During quarantine or self-isolation you might find it convenient to stock up on [protein supplements](/collections/protein-powder). Protein powder can be stored easily, does not expire quickly, and can help you meet your daily protein requirements. The best protein powder to buy are dairy protein if your diet allows for it. Whey protein powder and casein powder are the most bio-available proteins you can buy and are a cheap protein to add to your diet.

Our more popular products are our pure protein powders [Whey Protein Isolate (WPI)](/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder) and [Whey Protein Concentrate (WPI)](/products/premium-whey-wpc). If you are wondering “what is the difference between WPI and WPC?”, you can read more about that [here](https://vpa-australia.myshopify.com/blogs/supplements/wpi-vs-wpc-what-s-the-difference), but in summary WPI is more refined and has a higher whey protein content than WPC. Both whey protein powders make a great addition to your cooking, baking, breakfast smoothies and more!
