## What is L-Carnitine?

You’ve probably heard the [L-carnitine](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/l-carnitine?variant=32462615085111) is a fat-burner and can assist in performance, but probably unaware of the science behind the amino acid. Firstly an amino acid is the building block of proteins. L-carnitine is an amino acid that is naturally produced in the body within the liver and kidneys. Although L-carnitine is primarily stored within the muscle, including the brain. Now let’s deep dive into the questions of what is l-carnitine and how it works in your body.

### L-Carnitine and Energy

L-carnitine is involved in energy metabolism and mitochondrial protection (mitochondria are essentially the heart of your cells). L-carnitine is able to alleviate the effects of ageing and disease on mitochondria while increasing the mitochondria’s potential to burn fat.

### L-Carnitine and Fat Burning

Carnitine is an essential nutrient for the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix, using fat stores for energy. Researchers have found that carnitine is essential in the oxidation of lipids.

Looking at the synthesis of carnitine it requires two amino acids lysine & methionine and three vitamins, ascorbate, niacin and vitamin B6 and a metal ion (reduce iron). A deficiency in any of one of these nutrients would result in considerably impaired carnitine synthesis.

The muscles of the body, as well as many other tissues, depend primarily on fatty acid oxidation as a source of energy. Because they cannot synthesize carnitine, its transport into these tissues is of critical importance*.

### How do you consume L-Carnitine?

L-carnitine can be obtained by diet, primarily found in meat and other animal products but also sound in some plant products like soybeans, nuts, seeds, asparagus, broccoli, garlic, parsley, kale, bananas, bee pollen, corn, rice bran, oatmeal, whole wheat etc. The standard supplementation dose for L-carnitine is between 500-2,000mg, which can be hard to consume from only food sources, and this is why an L-Carnitine supplement can be extremely effective
