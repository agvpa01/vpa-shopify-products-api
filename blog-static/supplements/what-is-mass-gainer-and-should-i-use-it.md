Have you ever browsed the VPA® online supplement shop and wondered what exactly is VPA® Muscle Gainer, and how is it different from other products we sell? This blog will lay out the facts about this product and explain what it is, and who should use it. Let’s begin by understanding what is mass gainer.

## What are mass gainers?

Mass gainers, also known as bulking powders, are supplements for weight gain. Mass gainers differ from pure protein supplements like whey protein isolate (WPI) powder, whey protein concentration (WPC) and casein, in the sense that they combine protein with carbohydrates and fat to provide a high-calorie and high-protein supplement. This makes them a popular choice for those in the bulking phase of their fitness journey.

## Who should use mass gainers?

Most people take protein supplements to build muscle or aid recovery. Under what circumstances would you choose a mass gainer over a pure protein supplement to achieve these goals?

Have you heard the term “hard gainer” before? This term is used to describe people who have an ectomorph body type or those who find it difficult to add muscle mass or gain weight. To gain weight you need to be eating more calories than your body burns. Hard gainers often have a very high energy expenditure due to holding physically demanding jobs and putting many hours into training. In addition, they find it difficult to eat enough food to provide the energy needed to promote muscle growth. This is where a protein powder for weight gain can help. For these individuals, a mass gainer provides a convenient, drinkable source of calories and protein, making it easier to meet their energy needs and support muscle growth.

## Who should avoid mass gainers?

Mass gainers are not for everyone. If your goal is to lose fat while gaining muscle, mass gainers may not be the best option. In this case, pure protein supplements like WPI or WPC would be a better choice as these provide adequate protein without the added carbohydrate calories. This means you will access your fat stores for energy, helping you lose fat mass.

How do mass gainers work?

Mass gainers are made to increase your intake of protein, carbohydrates, and calories, which are essential for building muscle while simultaneously gaining weight. By consuming these additional nutrients, you enhance muscle protein synthesis– the process your body uses to repair and build muscle tissue. Additionally, carbohydrates and (at times) fats provide calories and energy to fuel training sessions. These additional calories also help maintain a calorie surplus which is important for weight gain. This is why mass gainers are also referred to as protein powder for weight gain.

In addition to boosting calorie intake, mass gainers support a positive protein balance, which is a state where your body produces more protein than it breaks down. Over time, the sustained use of these supplements along with adequate training leads to muscle growth and weight gain.

## Key ingredients in mass gainers

Mass gainer protein powders differ from standard protein powders due to their high caloric content and a blend of ingredients that is designed to support weight gain and muscle development. The composition of mass gainer supplements usually varies by product. Here's a closer look at the key ingredients of VPA® Muscle Gainer Powder and how each ingredient works to fuel your fitness goals:

1. Whey protein concentrate (WPC)
At the core of VPA® Muscle Gainer is whey protein concentrate (WPC) powder which delivers your body a faster supply of protein and amino acids to feed your muscle tissue. With a protein percentage of approximately 80% and very low fat and carbohydrate levels (only 0.7g and 1.5g respectively), VPA® WPC is extracted using ultra-filtration processes ensuring the protein is left in its most natural form.

2. Maltodextrin
Maltodextrin is a complex carbohydrate made from corn, rice or potato. Not only does this highly absorbed carbohydrate offer the necessary calorie density required for muscle growth, but it also encourages an anabolic effect in the body after training through the release of insulin.

3. Dextrose monohydrate
Dextrose Monohydrate is a highly absorbed single-chain carbohydrate derived from corn, which supports maltodextrin in the muscle growth process by also offering excess calories and promoting faster insulin production through its gastric emptying ability. Both of these carbohydrates work together to create an extremely anabolic setting in your body.

4. Creatine monohydrate
Creatine has been recognised as one of the most effective supplements for strength and muscle gains for decades. Creatine can increase the body’s phosphocreatine stores, which help your body produce more of a high-energy molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This is crucial in producing energy in your muscles, especially during high-intensity exercise.

## Benefits of using mass gainers

Mass gainer protein powders offer an efficient way to meet the nutritional demands of those in the bulking phase. Athletes, bodybuilders and fitness enthusiasts can use mass gainers for various benefits like:

1. Meeting caloric requirements:
Mass gainers are calorie-dense, providing a substantial energy boost in a single serving. VPA® Muscle Gainer Powder provides more than 1300 calories per serving size of 80 grams. This makes it easier to achieve a caloric surplus, which is essential for weight gain. This protein powder is therefore especially useful for individuals who find it difficult to consume large food portions throughout the day.

2. Macronutrients for bulking:
A good mass gainer provides a well-rounded mix of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. This balance ensures that you’re gaining weight in a controlled way, avoiding excessive fat accumulation. VPA® Muscle Gainer Powder, for instance, is a blend of high-quality protein, fast-absorbing carbohydrates, and creatine.

3. Promotes muscle growth and recovery:
The high-quality protein content in mass gainers, derived from sources like whey and micellar casein protein powder, provides the amino acids necessary for muscle repair and growth. After intense exercise, these supplements help replenish glycogen stores, reduce muscle fatigue, and accelerate recovery.

4. Convenient solution for hard gainers
For those with difficulty gaining weight, mass gainers offer a practical solution by providing easily digestible and fast-absorbing calories that help achieve calorie surplus.
