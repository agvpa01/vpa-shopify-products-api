### Why should I use protein powder?

Protein powder is one of the most purchased supplements on the market. This is because it serves a dual purpose that many other supplements don’t. Firstly it’s a food that helps you feel satiated and full. You can take it on it’s own as a shake, mixed in with a smoothie or some oats. You can even use it in recipes to make high protein snack. Secondly, as a sports supplement protein powder is one of few supplements for which strong scientific evidence for it’s effectiveness exits.

Protein is made up of amino acids which are used in our body for muscle growth and repair. Protein is a vitally important nutrient for those wanting to grow muscles and increase strength. It is also important for those that give themselves a beating during training and need to optimise recovery. Amino acids play other essential roles in the body including the synthesis of hormones, enzymes and neurotransmitters. Amino acids are also a source of energy during intense exercise. Put simply, protein is vital to maintaining health.

While most people can get enough protein through their usual diet, protein powder is a convenient source of high quality pure protein.

### When should I take protein powder?

Protein powder can be taken at any time of day. However, if you are looking to maximise muscle building and recovery you should take it before or after exercise. Around 30 minutes before, and within an hour after training is ideal.

### What are the different types of protein powder?

The most common protein powders are derived from dairy milk. Whey protein isolate (WPI), whey protein concentrate (WPC) and casein are the three different protein powders that are processed. Whey protein concentrate and whey protein isolate differ only in their processing and purity. You can read more about that [here](https://vpa-australia.myshopify.com/collections/protein-powder/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder).

#### Whey Protein Isolate

WPI is cold filtered two times and when pure, has around a 90% protein content. If your WPI is not around 90% protein, then it is not really WPI! Because of the extra processing costs and higher purity, WPI is more expensive than other protein types. WPI is the fastest digesting protein, and is ideal for instigating muscle building and repair after exercise. It’s high leucine content means that it is superior to other protein powders if you are looking to maximise muscle building. It’s low lactose content means it is well tolerated by most people who need a lactose free protein powder due to lactose intolerance. WPI is an ideal healthy snack as protein is the most satiating of the three macronutrients, and is low in calories. This makes WPI the best protein for losing weight.

#### Whey Protein Concentrate

WPC is only filtered one time, and therefore has a slightly higher carbohydrate and fat content compared to WPI. A pure whey protein concentrate should have around 80% protein. The slightly higher carb and fat content means that WPC is more slowly digested and absorbed compared to WPI. This is useful if you want a protein that will keep you feeling a little more full in between meals. It also gives the protein a slightly creamier taste and texture when made on water, and some people find it more enjoyable to drink than WPI for this reason. WPC is also a good choice of protein to lose weight. Although it is slightly higher in calories than WPI, it does make for a more complete meal and can lead to you feeling more satisfied.
