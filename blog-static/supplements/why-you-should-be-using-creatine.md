Creatine is one of those supplements that we, and all goods sports dietitians, recommend to everyone. Along with protein, it is one of the most beneficial and cost-effective supplements on the market. Here we will explain three good reasons why you should be adding it to your supplement stack. But first, let’s answer the most important question…

### What is creatine?

Creatine is a naturally occurring compound in our bodies. Our liver, and to a lesser extent our pancreas and kidneys, produce creatine using the amino acids glycine and arginine. We also get it from foods including red meat and seafood. Creatine molecules act as storage units for high energy phosphate groups, which are an essential part of our energy production system. Creatine increases the rate at which we can use energy within our bodies.

#### 3. It is versatile

Creatine is almost flavorless and is sold as a natural powder with no added flavor. It has a slightly bitter taste and sometimes may have a slightly grainy texture, but most people find it palatable. Being unflavored means that it can be added to anything you are drinking. Many people like to add it to their protein shake, but it can just as easily be added to juice or taken in plain water.

### OK, so how should I take creatine?

We’ve convinced you that you need it, and now you are wondering how to take it. For best results, creatine should be taken in a 5-7 day loading phase of around 20g per day. This should be followed by daily supplementation of 2-5g a day depending on your body weight. It can be taken on its own in water or with other supplements.

### The best time to take creatine

The benefits of creatine are best seen when the levels within our muscles are consistently high. This means that it should be taken every day, with the timing of when you do so being unimportant. Creatine is not a supplement you need to take immediately before you train. Many people add it to their daily routine by taking it with their other supplements in the morning or simply in water at the same time each day.
