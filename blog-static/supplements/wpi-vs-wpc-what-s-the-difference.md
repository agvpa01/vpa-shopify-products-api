## If you’re in the market for whey protein, you've likely come across whey protein concentrate (WPC) and whey protein isolate (WPI). But what’s the difference, and which one best suits your goals? This blog will explain the difference between WPI vs WPC so that you can choose the best protein for you.

Protein is perhaps the most important supplement for fitness enthusiasts, bodybuilders, and athletes looking to have more control over their diet. It is a necessity for individuals looking to get fitter, healthier, or stronger. While protein powders may come from a variety of sources, the most effective protein powders are dairy and whey protein powders. Whey protein comes in two main forms, whey protein concentrate ([WPC](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/premium-whey-wpc)) and whey protein isolate ([WPI](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/whey-isolate-protein-powder)). Before we delve into the differences between the two, let’s examine what protein supplements are and where they come from.

### What Are Protein Supplements?

Protein supplements are dietary supplements used to meet daily nutritional requirements, especially when these goals are difficult to achieve through diet alone. These supplements typically come in powder form and can be used to improve athletic performance, enable muscle repair, and build muscle mass. Whey protein, specifically, is known for its rapid absorption and complete amino acid profile, making it an ideal choice for muscle recovery and growth. But when it comes to choosing whey protein, it’s important to understand the differences in WPI vs WPC protein. Let’s start by understanding what whey protein is.

### What is Whey Protein?

Whey protein is the powdered by-product of milk and cheese-making. So, the next time you spot those bottles of milk and blocks of cheese at the supermarket, remember that whey protein is what’s left over once the whey is separated from the milk.

### WPI vs WPC – What’s the difference?

| Aspect | WPC | WPI |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Production process | Less processed: Retains fats and carbs | More processed: Fats and carbs removed |
| Nutritional profile | Approx 75-80% protein, 4-7% fat, relatively high lactose content | Approx. 90% protein content, low-fat, low-carb, low-lactose |
| Biological and nutritional benefits | Contains amino acids, ideal high-protein snack | High in BCAAs, ideal for muscle recovery and growth |
| Digestibility and absorption | Slower digestion and absorption | Rapid digestion and absorption |
| Usage scenarios | Gain muscle mass, ideal if you want to feel full for longer | Gain lean muscle, ideal for a low-calorie diet |
| Cost-effectiveness and value | Less expensive | Slightly more expensive due to more processing, but contains more protein per serve |
| Suitability for different diets | Suitable for most diets | Suitable for lactose-intolerant diet |
| Potential allergens and intolerances | Contains lactose | Minimal lactose, better for lactose-intolerant people |
| Taste, flavour and solubility | Creamier and richer taste, thicker consistency | Mild flavour, thinner consistency and easily soluble |

### The Production Process

During production, WPI vs WPC are differentiated by their filtration levels: WPC is microfiltered once, while WPI is filtered a second time. This second filtration further removes fats and carbohydrates from the original product, producing a more refined protein. This process means that WPI is a more pure whey protein than WPC.

### Nutritional Profile

Due to being more highly refined, WPI has a higher protein, lower fat, and lower carbohydrate percentage compared to WPC. Good quality WPI vs WPC percentages are around 90% protein for WPI and about 75-80% for WPC. VPA® pure whey protein concentrate has 23g of protein per serve, 0.7g of fat and 1.5g of sugars from lactose. VPA® Whey protein isolate has 26g of protein per serve, 0.3g of fat, and only 0.3g of sugar.
