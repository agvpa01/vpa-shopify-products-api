### RunKeeper

This is a great app if you are wanting to get serious with your cardio or are preparing for a marathon. This fitness app also features a GPS tracker that provides the user with different routes for running. In this way, you get to explore new places, have a different running view and stay motivated during your run.

RunKeeper is a free app for smartphones that turns your daily jog into a game. By setting up accounts with RunKeeper and other fitness apps, such as MyFitnessPal and Endomondo, RunKeeper creates a "Dietary Energy Equivalent" (DEE) score based on how many calories you burn per day from all activities. By syncing with your Fitbit or Apple Watch, it can track your steps and your heart rate to ensure that you're in the best shape of your life by 2022!

### 8Fit

Short for "8-minute Fitness," 8fit is a quick, no-frills workout app ideal for users who want to get in and out of their routine as quickly as possible. Users can choose from a range of workouts—HIIT (high-intensity interval training), Tabata, kettlebell, bodyweight and more—or create their own custom routines. Exercises are broken down into very simple steps with excellent how-to videos, so even if you're new to fitness, there's no need to feel intimidated.

8fit is another app that can be personalized. The best thing about this app is that it tracks and monitors your physical activities and provides you with step-by-step instructions when it comes to nutrition.

The creators of this app know that diet and exercise go hand in hand and made sure that they address that in their app. The app's main goal is to help people create healthy habits and not just achieve fitness goals.

### MyFitnessPal

MyFitness Pal was created under the brand Under Armour. This company is passionate about fitness and has gone out of its way to help people access fitness help through an app. The app has three main features: A calorie counter, Fitness and Diet tracker.

This app also has over 5 million foods in its database that can really help the user track their diet.

MyFitnessPal is the best free app for tracking a diet and healthy eating plan because it offers a huge database of food items, nutritional information, and even restaurants!

This app is ideal if you are serious about losing weight since it allows you to keep track of what you eat in detail. It also helps you count calories and log your exercise routine. It's free, so there is no reason left not to try it!

### Fitbit Coach

Fitbit is well known for its smartwatches. What can be better than providing a fitness app to help people reach their goals faster? One of the things that we love about this app is, anyone can use it. You don't need to have a fitness smartwatch to access it.

Fitbit Coach can provide you with if you want a real person and not an AI to coach you on your exercises. This makes the experience more personalized.

If you do have a Fitbit, that makes it even better. If you're not a member of the Fitbit family yet, let me walk you through the perks. It's a wearable device that tracks your activity and sleep patterns, and it syncs that data to its app so you can see how you stack up against your friends, your fitness goals and the rest of the world.

That same app offers a handful of guided workouts, where Fitbit Coach comes in. It's more than just a simple timer; it gives you guidance on sets, reps and even how much weight to use as you move through exercises. And it gives you constant encouragement along the way.

Fitbit Coach was offered as an optional paid feature on Fitbit devices last year but is now included with all Fitbit devices at no extra cost. That means anyone with a new Charge 2 or Ionic smartwatch can use the app free of charge — and if you've already been using it on your phone, feel free to upgrade to a new device and bring those workout plans along for the ride.
