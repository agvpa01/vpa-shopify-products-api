## What are the best leg workouts for muscle growth?

Some of the best leg workouts for muscle growth include squats, deadlifts, lunges, Bulgarian split squats, and leg presses. These exercises target multiple muscle groups simultaneously, promoting overall leg development. However, let's get into them as enumerated below:

### Squats: The King of Leg Exercises

**Squats** are renowned as the ultimate leg exercise, targeting multiple muscle groups simultaneously. This compound movement engages the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes, making it a highly effective exercise for muscle growth.

To perform squats correctly, start with your feet shoulder-width apart, lower yourself down while keeping your back straight, and push back up to the starting position. Aim for 3 sets of 8-12 reps, gradually increasing the weight as you progress.

### Deadlifts: Engaging Multiple Muscle Groups

**Deadlifts** not only work your legs but also engage your core and back muscles. This powerful compound exercise is ideal for developing overall strength and size in your lower body.

Begin with lighter weights and focus on maintaining proper form. As your strength increases, progress to performing 3 sets of 8 reps with heavier weights.

### Lunges: Targeting the Quadriceps, Hamstrings, and Glutes

**Lunges** are a fantastic exercise for targeting the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. They also help improve balance and stability.

To perform lunges, step forward with one leg, lower your body until both knees are at a 90-degree angle, and then push back up to the starting position. Alternate between legs and aim for 2-3 sets of 12-15 reps per leg.
