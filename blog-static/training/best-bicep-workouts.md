#### Best Bicep Exercises for More Muscle

The biceps, consisting of the biceps brachii (with their long and short heads) and the brachialis, are a popular muscle group that many seek to develop. Here are some of the best bicep exercises for muscle growth:

1. **BARBELL CURL**
   - A foundational exercise for biceps using a straight or EZ curl bar.
   - Targets both the long and short heads of the biceps brachii.

2. **DUMBBELL CURL**
   - It can be performed standing or seated, either alternating or simultaneously.
   - Provides a more extended range of motion than the barbell curl.
