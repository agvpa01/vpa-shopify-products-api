### Let us talk Booty Gains
Gluteus Minimus, Gluteus Medius and Gluteus Maximus. The glutes are made up of these three main muscles and are the foundation of all lower body movements. Glutes that are trained to generate force through these muscles will assist you to jump higher, run faster, squat heavier, deadlift heavier and become a better athlete in general.

### Glute training for Men
Glute training, although widely seen as female only territory due to the way some glute exercises are performed; men should not shy away from it. You can train your legs as many times per week as you like, but in my opinion, you cannot build a decent amount of muscle mass in your quads without strong and muscular glutes. So, if you want the quads, you must train the glutes!

### Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS)
When it comes to training the Glutes, I like to use the KISS analogy (Keep It Simple Stupid). There are hundreds of fiddly glute exercises all over the gram that claim to isolate the three main muscles of the glutes, but I find many of these to be time-consuming and not ideal for the daily, natural, biomechanics of the human body's functions.

### Importance of Glute Training
Unfortunately, due to modern-day society, the increasing demand for typical 9-5 office jobs, and advancements in technology, the need to use our glutes has significantly decreased. This is because we are now spending most of our days in stationary seated positions, causing the glutes to become weaker and under-trained, leaving us with unshapely booty's. This also causes the surrounding musculature to become weaker and take more of the workload, leading to increased risk of injury. Hence why it is necessary to target one of our body's largest and most powerful muscle groups by implementing these glute developing movements.

### My Top 6 Best Glute Exercises

#### 1. Wide Stance Hack Squats or Barbell Squats
If using a squat machine such as the hack squat; opt for a wider and slightly higher stance as this will provide more glute/hamstring activation. The squat is one of the best overall lower body building exercises, targeting the quads, hamstrings, and glutes. I would suggest performing the type of squat that powerlifters use, which is called a low-bar squat for better glute/hamstring activation. Another way to enhance glute development, is to ensure you are reaching depth with your squats, parallel or below if you can. If you do partial reps when squatting the load is mostly in your quads so reduce the weight if you need to, focus on your stance, depth and squeeze your glutes at the top of the movement.

#### 2. Heavy Barbell Hip Thrusts
The Hip Thrust is a glute exercise designed to improve your strength, speed, and power through optimal hip extension. Although the word thrust implies a fast and explosive movement, I would suggest hip thrusts be performed in a controlled manner with a brief pause and squeeze at the top of each rep.

#### 3. Lunges
Lunges are one of my all-time favourite lower body exercises. Performing walking lunges will help develop your glutes, hamstrings, quads, calves and even your inner and outer hips and thighs. Lunges are a great exercise to do at the end of your workout especially for your glutes because of the degree of hip extension involved, especially with longer strides. Another great thing about lunges, they can be easily modified from very easy bodyweight lunges to extremely difficult reverse weighted lunges and many more variations to suit all fitness and strength levels.

#### 4. Bulgarian Split Squat
The Bulgarian split squat is a unilateral movement; it helps you build up strength and stability. To emphasize your glutes, take a slightly longer stride and place your foot further out in front of your body compared to the standard variation. This will shift more of the load into your glutes when performing the movement. If you would like to increase the difficultly of this exercise, try holding dumbbells at your side or use a smith machine and add additional plates.

#### 5. Romanian Deadlifts
