### What is Blood Circulation?
Blood circulation occurs in the circulatory system and is basically the movement of blood throughout the body carrying oxygen, nutrients, and hormones to cells, and removing waste products. Blood transports carbon dioxide to the lungs for exhalation and picks up oxygen through the network of arteries, veins, and capillaries. The blood collects food nutrients from the small intestine and transports them to every cell in the body.

### But why is this important and how does good blood flow affect athletic performance?
During exercise, there is a transportation of oxygen from the lungs to the tissue and delivery of metabolically produced CO2 to the lungs for expiration. It is important to adopt [good breathing techniques](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/breathing-techniques-for-training) during training so good circulation is observed. Improving blood flow allows more oxygen to reach your muscles, which means that your workout will be more effective and last longer and decrease possible fatigue. As you work out, the oxygen that enters your muscles transforms the available glucose into ATP, giving your body the energy it needs to finish your workout.

### How can one improve Blood circulation?
1. Drink water
   Drinking water aids in digestion and it helps carry nutrients and oxygen to our cells. According to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, the adequate daily fluid intake is about 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) of fluids for men and 11.5 cups (2.7 liters) of fluids a day for women.

2. Stretch
   Stretching helps increase blood flow to your bodyâ€™s tissues and organs. You can incorporate stretching in your daily routine by allotting a few minutes for it early in the morning or before and after a workout.

3. Exercise
   Exercise can help boost circulation as well as improve mental health. A few minutes of exercises like walking, running, and the like can be just as effective.

4. Manage Stress
   Heightened stress can cause an increase in blood pressure and can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.

5. Include Omega-3 Fatty Acids
   Foods containing Omega-3 fatty acids are proven to promote cardiovascular health and improve circulation.

### The role of AAKG in improving blood circulation
Arginine-alpha-ketoglutarate, also known as AAKG, boosts nitric oxide production, which causes blood vessels to dilate and improve blood flow to the muscles. When performing resistance training, the blood supply to the working muscles is allegedly improved by the AAKG supplement, leading to greater muscle strength than with exercise alone.
