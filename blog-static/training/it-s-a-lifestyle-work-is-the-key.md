## WORK IS THE KEY

Every morning we wake up and are faced with the decision of how we are going to walk into the world, how we are going to choose to live, how we are going to use our energy. Einstein said, “work is the only thing that gives substance to life”. At first, this statement can sound shallow if we think about the idea of work in the way many of us hear it being used day to day. But when you think of ‘work’ as the expenditure of energy and focus towards a meaningful goal, this quote becomes truth. Your current goal may be to lose 15kgs, to build a closer relationship with your partner, to discover your full potential, or to overcome your fears that have been holding you back from living a full life. Imagine how your life would change if you committed to “work as hard as you possibly could on one thing and see what happens” (Jordan Peterson). Now that type of work would indeed give substance to your life, and not only your life but the lives of those around you. So when you wake up tomorrow morning and life asks you how you are going to choose to live, I challenge you to ignore the easy path of mediocrity and fuel your life with substance and meaning by doing the hard work and watch how your life changes.

“Faith will get you to a point. Luck will get you to a point. But to achieve the kind of success you dream about, you need to WORK. There are no shortcuts, you can’t cheat life, just get to work and don’t stop until you reach your highest potential.” – **Denzel Washington**

“Success isn’t always about greatness. It’s about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come.” – **Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson**

“90% of success is just showing up. You’re not going to feel perfect everyday. Get there and start working.” – **Joe Rogan**

“If you don’t find the time, if you don’t do the work, you don’t get the results.” – **Arnold Schwarzenegger**
