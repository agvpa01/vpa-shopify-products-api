### The Powerhouse: Muscles Engaged in a Pull-Up

At its core, a pull-up is an upper-body exercise that uses your body weight as resistance. The pull-up is a compound exercise, meaning it works multiple muscle groups simultaneously. Here's the key cast performing this impressive feat:

- **Latissimus dorsi (Lats):** These large back muscles are the primary movers, responsible for pulling your body up.
- **Biceps brachii (Biceps):** Your biceps assist the lats, flexing your elbows to bring you closer to the bar.
- **Brachialis:** This muscle sits under the biceps and plays a crucial role in elbow flexion during the pull.

---

- **Teres major:** Located on the side of your upper back, it works alongside the lats for pulling and shoulder rotation.
- **Forearms:** Your grip strength comes into play here, with the forearms stabilizing your hold on the bar.
- **Core:** Don't underestimate the core! A strong core keeps your body stable and prevents excessive swinging during the pull-up.
