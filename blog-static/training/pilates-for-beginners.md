If you are looking to start your fitness journey or seeking a refreshing change in your current workout routine, welcome aboard! Chances are, you are thinking of exploring pilates but what is it and what are its origins?

Pilates is a series of exercises designed to improve physical strength, flexibility, and posture, while also enhancing mental awareness. Originated in the early 20th century by a German physical trainer named Joseph Pilates, this regimen was formulated for injured athletes and dancers for a fast and effective recovery. Pilates exercises can be done on a mat or on special equipment, such as a reformer, which provides resistance and support.

## Who is pilates good for?

Pilates is a versatile form of exercise that can be beneficial for a wide range of individuals as well as different fitness levels as it can be customised to fit individual goals and needs. Pilates can cater to a variety of people from complete beginners to athletes, seniors, post-rehabilitation patients, and even pregnant women with a special prenatal pilates program.

## Six Principles of Pilates

- **Breath** – Proper breathing is fundamental to pilates. You should inhale deeply through your nose, expanding your ribcage, and exhale fully through your mouth, engaging your abdominal muscles. The breath helps you maintain control, focus, and stability during exercises.
- **Concentration** – the mind-body connection is crucial in pilates. Focus on the quality of your movements, paying attention to alignment, form, and muscle engagement. Avoid distractions and practice with intention.
- **Control** – Pilates encourages precise and controlled movements. Avoid using momentum or jerky motions. Instead, move with deliberation and control to engage and strengthen specific muscles.
- **Centering** – Pilates emphasises the concept of a “powerhouse,” which includes your abdominal muscles, lower back, pelvic floor, and buttocks. All movements start from this center, which provides stability and supports your spine.
- **Precision** – Each exercise in Pilates has a specific form and alignment. Pay close attention to the details of each movement, as precision is more important than quantity. Proper form reduces the risk of injury and maximizes the benefits.
- **Flow** – Pilates exercises are often performed in a flowing and continuous manner. Transitions between movements should be smooth and controlled, promoting grace and efficiency in your practice.

For beginners wondering about the essential tips for pilates, an understanding of its foundational principles is paramount. These principles work synergistically to create a harmonious balance between your mind and body, making pilates a holistic form of exercise.

## Getting Familiar with Pilates Equipment: From Reformers to Mat Work

If you’re just starting out with Pilates, all you really need is your body, a mat, and a towel. However, if you plan to join Pilates classes in a studio should be introduced to the Pilates Reformer, a versatile machine that provides resistance for a variety of exercises. Selecting between mat work and equipment is a personal choice and depends on your fitness goals.
