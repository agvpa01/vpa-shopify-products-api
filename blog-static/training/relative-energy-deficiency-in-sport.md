## What is RED-S?

Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport, “RED-S” or simply “RED-S” is a clinically defined syndrome referring to the impairment of physiological function caused by a deficit in a person’s **energy intake** relative to the **energy required** to maintain optimal health, homeostasis, growth, the activities of daily living, and sport.  

Being in this state of relative deficit is often also referred to as being in a state of low energy availability (LEA). In this state, there is a lower than required amount of energy for the body’s normal physiological functions.

This can have a variety of health consequences including:  

- Altered metabolic function
- Menstrual disturbances and amenorrhea (loss of period)
- [Amenorrheic athletes have 2 to 4 times greater risk for a stress fracture](https://doi.org/10.2165/00007256-199928020-00004)
- Impaired bone health (increased osteoporosis risk)
- Reductions in immune system function
- Reduced protein synthesis (ie for muscles and tendons)
- Impacts on cardiovascular health

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has developed two RED-S models. This first one shows 10 health consequences linked to RED-S:

## Who is at risk of RED-S?

Active men or women with disordered eating or with an eating disorder are at risk.

**Disordered eating** (DE) is a term that refers to a range of irregular eating behaviors but does not fit the full criteria to be diagnosed as a specific eating disorder.  The DE continuum can lead to clinical eating disorders (EDs), abnormal eating behaviors, distorted body image, weight fluctuations, medical complications, and variable athletic performance.

DE can include (but isn’t limited to) things like:  

- Chronic restrictive eating
- Excessive fasting
- Food-related anxiety
- Skipping meals
- Restricting entire food groups
- Negative preoccupation with food
- Negative preoccupation with weight and body image
- Misuse of laxatives or diuretics

**Eating disorders** (ie) are serious mental health disorders that can have life-threatening consequences.
