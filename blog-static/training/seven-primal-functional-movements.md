### There’s nothing like going back to our roots and moving like our ancestors in a world where we spend most of our days sitting and slumped behind our desks and hopping into our cars to take us from home to work. In today’s article, we discuss the importance and benefits of incorporating primal functional movements into your fitness routine.

### What are Primal movements?

Primal movements, often referred to in the context of exercise and fitness, are fundamental human movements that are based on natural, functional patterns of motion. These movements are inspired by the way our ancestors moved in their daily activities and are considered essential for building overall strength, mobility, and functional fitness.

Primal movements are often used in functional fitness training to improve physical performance and address imbalances in the body. While there are variations in the classification of primal movements, the following are considered the seven primal functional movements:
