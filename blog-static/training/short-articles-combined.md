The benefits of strength training for endurance athletes

Strength training has an important part to play in the program of all endurance athletes. While it can be hard to fit into your training program, it should be considered a necessary component of training for athletes who want to run faster and remain injury free. Incorporating strength work into your training has benefits for health, general athleticism and sports performance. This blog will explain why endurance athletes should be strength training and what benefits to their health and performance they can expect.

---

### The benefits of strength training for endurance athletes

Strength training can benefit endurance athletes in three areas.

- Health – Strength training prevents injury by addressing muscle imbalances created during the repetitive movement of endurance sports.
- Athleticism – All athletes need to have sufficient strength, stability, power and mobility to train for the specifics of their sport. Strength training contributes to all of these.
- Performance – Strength training leads to increased power (rate of force production) and improves running and cycling economy; many studies have shown increased performance, and none show a decrease.

---

### Strength training for masters athletes

For masters athletes, strength training is even more important. As we age, we lose muscle mass faster than we lose cardiovascular fitness. This leads to long term health issues as well as performance decline. You will slow the inevitable decline in performance by including strength work in your program.

---

### Strength training improves endurance performance

Studies have consistently shown endurance performance benefits in response to strength training. If you convincing, here are a couple of study results.

Blagrove (2017) found in a systematic review that strength training improved running economy, time trial performance and anaerobic speed, concluding that “the addition of two to three ST [strength training] sessions per week, which include a variety of ST modalities are likely to provide benefits to the performance of middle- and long-distance runners.”

[Ronnestad (2011)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19903319) found that combining heavy strength training and regular endurance training increased cyclists’ mean power output production during a final 5-min all-out sprint after 3 h of submaximal cycling by 7%. Sounds like a race winning strategy to me

---

### How does strength training improve endurance performance?

So now that we understand it does work, lets look at the possible mechanisms behind the benefits of strength training to endurance performance.

- Delayed use of less efficient type II (fast twitch) muscle fibres – With strength training, your Type I (slow twitch, endurance) muscle fibres become stronger so are working at a lower relative intensity during sub-maximal exercise. Stronger fibres mean than less muscle mass is used in each contraction, increasing the amount of rest each fibre gets. This means the Type I fibres can work for longer before becoming exhausted and forcing type II fibres to step in.
- Conversion of muscle fibre types – Some studies have shown increased proportion of Type IIA fibres. Type IIA are more efficient and fatigue more slowly so are more suited to endurance performance.
- Rate of force development – Increases in neural activation (how your brain activates muscle fibres) improve economy in both runners and cyclists (especially for low cadence work).
- Muscle-tendon stiffness – Elastic storage and return of energy by tendons contributes a large component of the energy needed for running. Stiffer tendons are more effective and reduce the overall energy demands, even at relatively slow speeds.

Now that you understand why strength training should be an integral part any endurance program, my next blog will talk about how to incorporate it into your training.

### Are you a crossfit athlete or do you love high intensity training? You might not have thought about a secret tool you could use in the gym to give an edge to your workouts – sports gels. Typically thought of as a supplement used by endurance athletes, sports gels can also improve the performance of high intensity athletes. Whether you are a crossfit athlete, a rugby player, or a tennis player, sports gels can give you an edge over your opponents.

### How to fuel your high intensity training

Nutrition underpins fitness and health and getting it right can help you get the most out of your training sessions.

### Hydration needs for high intensity training

[Regardless of how long your workout is, starting your session properly hydrated is key](https://www.sportsdietitians.com.au/factsheets/food-for-your-sport/crossfit/). You can tell if you’re properly hydrated by checking the colour of your pee – aim for a pale straw like colour. If your workout is longer than half an hour make sure you are regularly drinking. For short efforts water is fine. Once intensity starts increasing, you’ll need to think about carbohydrate and electrolyte replacement such as with a sports drink. Keeping your water cool will help keep it palatable and help you drink more.

### Fuel for high intensity training

When you exercise your body uses two sources of fuel to feed your muscles – fat and carbohydrates. [Carbohydrates are used as the main fuel source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6019055/) – and are relied on more for high intensity exercise. We store carbohydrates as glycogen in the muscles. As we exercise, muscle glycogen levels begin to fall. If these stores are not replenished performance can be affected. To start your session with your glycogen stores full, eat a carbohydrate rich snack or meal 2-4 hours before training. With a couple of hours before your workout a sandwich and a piece of fruit is great (I love toast with peanut butter and sliced banana). The closer to the start of your workout the easier to digest your snack needs to be – this is where a sports gel can be a quick, easy to digest option.

For training sessions less than an hour water is sufficient. [If you are exercising for more than 75 minutes you will benefit from some additional carbohydrates during your workout](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/eat-before-workout#section1). Ideally, you will take in about 30-60 grams of carbohydrates every hour. This will maintain blood glucose levels to fuel your muscles and brain and help you avoid “hitting the wall”. You’ll also get more out of your training session as you will be able to sustain the intensity for longer. Sports gels can provide simple sugars which are quickly absorbed into your blood stream as glucose to give you a spike in energy. Sports gels can also contain other ingredients like electrolytes such as sodium to replace minerals lost through sweat. They can be an easy way to quickly top up your energy stores before they fall and affect performance.

### About VPA® Performance Gels

[VPA® Performance Gels](/products/performance-gel-12-pack-3-flavours) use two types of carbohydrates. They contain fast acting fructose to give you a quick acting energy boost. They also contain maltodextrin which is a slower acting energy source. Using two types of carbohydrates means that your gut can absorb more carbohydrate, and your muscles will get a steady stream of energy. Using multiple types of carbohydrate is easier for the stomach to digest, promotes muscle carbohydrate oxidation and enhances performance. VPA® Gels provide 25g of carbs and 100 calories in each gel. As they contain water they are more convenient and quicker to absorb. They also contain sodium to replace electrolytes lost from sweat.

### How do I use sports gels?

Start taking gels early in a long high intensity training session to keep the glycogen stores topped up. This allows you to perform at your peak. Give the body time to use the gels before adding another one on top. One gel every 45 minutes to an hour is sufficient – there is no benefit from over consuming them. If you are preparing for an event, include gels in your sessions to allow the body to adapt and benefit from their use.

Next time you’re out for a hard high intensity session try taking a gel and notice the difference it makes!

## Why do I need a sports gel?

---

When you exercise your body uses two sources of fuel to feed your muscles – fat and carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are used as the main fuel source. If you’re exercising for less than an hour, you will have enough stored carbohydrates as glycogen in the muscles. However, if you are exercising for more than 75 minutes you will benefit from some additional carbohydrates. [Ideally you will take in about 30-60 grams of carbohydrates every hour](https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/fulltext/2016/03000/Nutrition_and_Athletic_Performance.25.aspx). This will maintain blood glucose levels to fuel your muscles and brain and help you avoid “hitting the wall”. You’ll also get more out of your training session as you will be able to sustain the intensity for longer.

---

## What is a sports gel?

---

Sports gels provide simple sugars. These can be quickly absorbed into your blood stream as glucose to give you a spike in energy. Gels are convenient because they contain a lot of carbohydrate in a small volume of food and don’t require chewing. Sports gels contain about [25g of carbohydrate which is about the right amount to fuel 45 minutes of exercise](https://www.vpa.com.au). For quicker absorption, look for a gel that have two different forms of carbohydrates, such as glucose and fructose.

Sports gels can also contain other ingredients like electrolytes such as sodium to replace minerals lost through sweat. Some also contain caffeine.

---

## When should I take my sports gel?

---

If your run or ride is going to take longer than 90 minutes it is time to start trialing gels and find one that works for you. We all absorb and process carbohydrates at a different rate. Gels vary in texture and taste, with some being thicker than others. Some people struggle with their texture, and they may cause stomach upset. Trial and error is the only way to determine which gel is going to work for you.

---

## How often should I take a gel?

---

This will depend on you but for most people taking one gel every 45 minutes to an hour will be about the right rate. Your digestion slows during exercise as blood is diverted from your stomach to your muscles. If you try to take gels more often than every 45 minutes you are likely to end up with an upset stomach through taking on too much simple sugar in one go.

Don’t forget to always consume your energy gel (regardless of brand) with water. This makes it quicker for your body to digest the gel and get the sugar into your blood stream. Never take an energy gel with sports drink because it will be too much sugar for your stomach in one go. Experiment with different fueling options in training so you can find a solution that works for you. Remember – nothing new on race day!

### With gyms all over Australia closed for several weeks now, I have no doubt there are a lot of you thinking that all of your hard work will go to waste. This is made harder since we have no idea when we can open again. It could be 2 months or 3 months or 6 months…who knows! If there is one thing Jacks and I know with absolute certainty though, it is this… NONE of your hard work is wasted and you won't lose your gains. How do we know this? First-hand experience!

"Out of adversity comes opportunity" – Benjamin Franklin

Both Jacks and I have had lengthy absences from training. I’ve had to come back from 2 major injuries, and over the years Jacks has had to prioritize her day job, running Iron Strength, and organizing competitions, with her most recent hiatus from training lasting 16 weeks. Yep, 4 months! Yet, she can still bust out a 180kg deadlift most days of the week once she’s back to training consistently. And that’s solely because of the hard work she has put in over the years. So all is not lost guys.

For those of you without access to a proper weights setup, this may be the longest forced layoff from strength training you will ever have to face. Yes, it feels like the end of the world and yes, it is not ideal. BUT, it is entirely manageable AND you could come out the other side in better shape than ever! This is the perfect OPPORTUNITY for us all to work on a number of areas we may not have prioritized in the past…myself included!

---

### Here are 3 things you can and should be doing while self-isolating:

---

#### 1. Sort your diet out…for real this time!

---

#### 2. Actually do all that mobility & stability work you should have been doing in the first place.

---

#### 3. Continue to train with whatever you have available…even if they are objects from the pantry or the garden shed.

---

### You won’t lose your gains!

The bottom line here: sitting around feeling sorry for yourself and eating everything in sight is absolutely pointless. If you want to keep those gains, it’s all there. Stop scrolling aimlessly through Covid-19 posts, and get to work! Let’s all come out the other side of this stronger, healthier and ready to shift some real IRON.

PS…sorry about the lame motivational quote, but it’s kinda fitting right now, don’t you think!?

### Bring your own toilet paper

- We all know that gyms are going to run out of dunny roll this flu season, so unless you want to get poop on your gym towel, then it’s essential to bring your own toilet paper.

### Wear a face mask

- If you can’t get your hands on a face mask, buy an altitude training mask. Not only will you sound and look like Darth Vader but you’ll also be protected from smelling the farts of your mates.

### Avoid making out with other gym goers

- This sounds tempting but is a definitely no-go during flu season especially with the coronavirus. The pash and dash is definitely only recommended during Summer months.

### Don’t drink Corona during your gym session

- This has nothing to do with Coronavirus, but it will make your gym sessions a bit fuzzy. You may seem funnier and have increased dancing ability but it’s probably not worth the injury risk. Try our [BCAA 7000](/products/bcaa-7000) instead as a delicious intra-workout drink. 😉

### It’s not food, a supplement, an exercise or a training regime, but research shows that listening to music helps your sporting performance. Whether you’re into metal, rock, hip-hop or country, the music you have in your gym playlist can help you bust out that sought after PB. We all know that music has the ability to strongly impact your mood, arousal, and emotions and this can impact your physical performance. Listening to music can delay fatigue and improve your work capacity. This can then [increase your endurance, power, and productivity and strength.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3339578/)

> Think of music as a type of legal performance enhancing drug

---

## Four ways that music can help your sporting performance

1. It’s distracting – Listening to music streaming through your headphones redirects your mind from the discomfort you experience when training. This might be particularly useful for those endurance athletes that are pushing hard for long periods of time.
2. The tempo of the music you listen to influences the rate at which you workout – Studies have shown that you will unconsciously synchronize your movements to the tempo of the music you are listening to. If you are wanting to increase the intensity or pace of your training, choosing music with a faster tempo may help you achieve that.
3. Music evokes emotions – As listeners we are able to relate to and take on the emotions of the music performer. Music that invokes feelings of anger, power, or excitement you can influence your emotions and that can help your performance.
4. It can increase your heart rate – Music impacts that part of the brain which stimulates arousal and increases heart rate. This can help prepare your body for optimal performance, before and during training.

## 1. Up Your Training Volume

Ava Fitzgerald, C.S.C.S., C.P.T., a sports performance coach of the Professional Athletic Performance Center in New York says “Compared to training for strength, intensity is going to drop during the hypertrophy phase of a program, with intensity sitting between 50 and 75 percent of the person’s 1RM, the maximum weight he or she can lift for one rep,”
To get the volume your muscles need, she recommends performing each of your lifts for three to six sets of 10 to 20 reps.

---

## 2. Slow down on the Eccentric Phase

According to research published in the European Journal of Applied Physiology, eccentric work is far better at triggering hypertrophy. The eccentric phase of your lift is the movement when you muscle is lengthening, also known as the negative phase.
To increase the amount of eccentric effort in your workout, you can do two things: either slow down the eccentric phase of each exercise you perform or integrate eccentric-only variations into your routine.

---

## 3. Reduce your Rest Between-Sets

According to the Journal of Applied Physiology, irrespective of rep and set scheme, fatiguing your muscles is a prerequisite for hypertrophy. Rest periods of 30 to 90 seconds encourage a quick release in muscle-building hormones (including testosterone and human growth hormone) while also making sure that you really, truly fatigue your muscles, according to the research.

---

## 4. Eat More Protein

Since exercise breakdown your muscle and protein rebuilds your muscle, it only makes sense to increase your protein intake if you are training hard and trying to build more muscle.
Research from the University of Stirling suggests that weight lifters need to eat 0.25 to 0.30 grams of protein per kilogram body weight per meal for muscle growth.

---

## 5. Focus on More Calories

Now it is impossible to build muscle if you are burning more calories than you are consuming every day, but the type of calories are also very important. In a 2014 Pennington Biomedical Research Center study, people who ate a high-calorie diet rich in protein stored about 45 percent of those calories as muscle, while those following a low-protein diet with the same number of calories stored 95 percent of those calories as fat.

---

## 6. Drink Casein Protein Before Bed

Because casein protein absorbs slowly into the bloodstream, it is able to feed your muscle a constant supply of protein and amino acids while you are sleeping and recovering. In one Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise study, consuming casein protein immediately before bed boosted young men’s levels of circulating amino acids for 7.5 hours; they built muscle all night long while they slept.

---

## 7. Get More Sleep

According to a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association, sleeping for five hours, as opposed to eight hours, per night for just one week cuts muscle-building testosterone levels by a whopping 10 to 15 percent.
The National Sleep Foundation recommends that adults ages 18 to 64 sleep seven to nine hours per night. No excuses.

### The ‘mind-muscle connection’ for muscle performance

The ‘mind-muscle connection’ has been the go-to strategy for lifters for years, where you focus your attention on a particular muscle when lifting to promote its activation and therefore its development. But when the goal is muscle performance rather than growth alone, does this long-held notion still carry any weight?

Published in *Frontiers in Sports and Active Living*, new analysis suggests that to lift heavier, or longer, it is better to focus on moving the weight itself — not your muscles.

### Think outside the body

Supporters of the mind-muscle connection believe that increased muscle activity when focusing on specific muscles while lifting is evidence that increased activity might just translate to increased muscle hypertrophy. Or, that a mind-muscle connection makes you expend more effort to lift the same weight.

“The higher overall muscle activity with an internal ‘muscle focus’ is not specific to the muscles mentally isolated during lifting,” says review author Professor David Neumann, of Griffith University, Australia. “Rather, it seems to represent increased activity of non-target muscles, too.”

But studies show that when lifters focus their attention on the external effects of their lifts, such as moving the barbell, lifts are done more economically and with less effort.

“It appears that this external focus allows automatic control processes to operate, removing the attentional demands and mechanical inefficiency of conscious muscular control,” poses Neumann.

In any case, as the load increases — at 80% of maximum effort in one bench press study — the muscle activity advantage of a muscle focus (internal focus), over an external focus, seems to disappear altogether.

### We all know that exercise is good for your health, but now new research is showing that it can make you smarter too.

Research scientists have shown that a short burst of exercise directly boosts activity in parts of the brain associated with learning and memory. The equivalent of 4000 steps or a casual game of social basketball was able to increase connections between neurons in the hippocampus. This discovery was made by analyzing genes that increased in single-neuron activity during exercise, in particular, the Mtss1L Gene. Researchers discovered that when this gene is activated by short bursts of exercise, it promotes neuron growth, in effect, showing that an acute burst of exercise is enough to prime the brain for learning.

"Exercise is cheap, and you don’t necessarily need a fancy gym membership or have to run 10 miles a day," said co-senior author Gary Westbrook, M.D., senior scientist at the OHSU Vollum Institute and Dixon Professor of Neurology in the OHSU School of Medicine.

### Does that style of routine look familiar?
A lot of us start with this trend of working out. We want to destroy that 1 muscle group, that it needs a whole week to recover. This will work great as a new gym goer as any sort of stimulus will work a treat. The idea of progressively overloading, adding more sets, adding more volume over the years isn’t something that is rushed. Over a long period you can progressively increase your daily volume from 3 sets of 4 exercises to 6 sets of 5 exercises. At some point there’s only so much you can work 1 muscle group in one session before you stop getting benefits. So eventually you will need to increase your frequency and overall volume for that week to create new stimulus.

E.g. No.1 On Monday you do 4 sets of 5 exercises for chest at a total of 20 sets for the week.

E.g. No.2 On Monday & Thursday you do 3 sets of 4 exercises for chest at a total of 24 sets for the week.

Option No.2 gives you a 20% increase in total volume for the week which is fantastic. But not only is it an increase in volume, but you have increased the frequency. Plenty of studies show that increased frequency of training a muscle group will increase protein synthesis which is a bonus.

Dr. Brad Schoenfeld conducted recent studies showing advantages of increasing training frequency.

A literature search was conducted to locate all studies that directly compared measures of hypertrophy for different weekly lifting frequencies using traditional resistance training programs. Only human studies with healthy subjects were considered, and study duration had to last a minimum of four weeks.

A total of 10 studies were identified that met inclusion criteria. 7 of the studies, comprising a total of 200 subjects, investigated muscle group frequency while the other 3 studies assessed training session frequency when the number of weekly times working a muscle group was matched.”

**“We first looked at the effects of frequency as a binary predictor. Simply stated, this means that the higher frequency condition in a study was compared to the lower frequency condition, irrespective of how many days a week the muscle group was trained. Thus, a 2 day-a-week vs 1 day-a-week was treated the same as a 3 day-a-week vs 1 day-a-week. In this model, there was a clear benefit for higher frequency training of a muscle group.”**

As you can see above, the 7 studies all favor increased training frequency vs. 1 day per week style of training.

Also, as you’re probably aware when your training, the more you train the same muscle group within that session, the quality of that training session quickly goes down. So if you were to train that muscle group twice per week, you might have to start train 2 muscle groups per session.

### An e.g would be training 3 sets of 4 exercises each for both legs and chest in one session.
An overall split might look like this.

- **Chest/Legs**
- **Back/Shoulders**
- **Arms/Core**
- **Chest/Legs**
- **Back/Shoulders**
- **Arms/Core**
- **Rest**

### Athletes and gym junkies alike are always striving for progression, improvement, and gains. It is obvious that to continually progress, a more physically taxing and exhausting regime must be enforced, however, on occasions this can be taken too far. Overtraining syndrome occurs when frequency, duration or intensity exceeds the functional limits for that individual, and can have a range of symptoms including lack of energy, aches and pains, headaches, muscle soreness, insomnia, and a sudden drop off in performance.

Literature by Kreher and Schwartz (2012) promotes that overtraining syndrome is simply your body telling you that it cannot keep up, and that it likely needs more food fuels, and/or greater recovery periods between workouts, along with sleep. Whilst the symptoms may be uncomfortable and limit performance, Kreher and Schwartz also recognise that the syndrome will also leave you susceptible to illness, due to a decreased immunity.

How is overtraining syndrome contracted? Budgett (1990), refers to the matter that the syndrome is not a physical illness, therefore cannot be spread as such like a virus. The research realises that from excessive training comes issues, and may begin with an injury followed by an inappropriate recovery period or protocol. The piece suggested that moving beyond 5 training sessions per week (depending on intensity and rest periods) is where athletes begin to become susceptible and should focus on their diet and recovery regime, along with sleep cycle, ensuring that their body has ample rest.

### How can you tell if you have an overtraining syndrome?

Whilst you may be experiencing symptoms, to be sure it is recommended to visit a general practitioner for a clinical diagnosis. From here, they will suggest alterations to diet and exercise to accommodate for the fatigue and resulting symptoms. Following confirmation from a GP, it is best to meet with professionals in the field such as a qualified nutritionist, and strength and conditioning coach. The nutritionist will be able to evaluate energy consumed versus the energy expended, and ensure that you have a surplus of calories in store to accommodate for the planned exercise. A strength and conditioning coach will be able to map out a gradual return to performance, ensuring that you fully recover. They will also look to mechanical efficiency, ensuring that you are performing your training without burning unnecessary energy.

### "Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today." - Jordan Peterson

So we are one month into the new year, where did the last 34 days go? We’ve all heard the stats about the high number of people who have already “failed” and given up on their new year resolutions, but this idea that we have failed if we have not been able to change our behaviour 1 month into a new year is stupid. What if we looked at our new year resolutions from a different angle, from a higher vantage point that actually empowered us to crush our goals. Instead of forcing yourself to stick to a new behaviour or restrict yourself from certain old behaviours for the whole year, why not give yourself a better challenge? What about telling yourself that by the end of 2019 I am going to transform myself by becoming the person who [INSERT NEW YEAR RESOLUTION].

*"by the end of 2019 I am going to transform myself by becoming the person who exercises every day"*

*"by the end of 2019 I am going to transform myself by becoming the person who doesn’t eat sugar"*

*"by the end of 2019 I am going to transform myself by becoming the person who journals every morning"*

*"by the end of 2019 I am going to transform myself by becoming the person who gets to bed by 9pm"*

Whatever your goal is, reframe it as a challenge for the whole year that you are going pursue, and not a goal that you are going to stick to until you have a moment of weakness, then give up because you “failed”. Get it into your head that you are guaranteed to fail at your goal, but that’s part of the process of developing a new behaviour. The trick is to wake up every morning with a fresh attitude and try again! Think about the hardest behaviours to change, addictions! In Alcoholics Anonymous, they tell their members to take it one day at a time, to focus on the one day ahead of them, and if they stumble, start again. Why don’t we take this same approach to our everyday behaviour change? If it can work for something such as drug and alcohol addictions, it only makes sense to apply it to our own addictions that we are trying to break, and yes many of our behaviours we are trying to change have some type of addiction element.

*Want to exercise more but can’t – you may be addicted to comfort*

*Want to eat healthily – you may be addicted to sugar*

*Want to sleep better – you may be addicted to the internet*

Of course, there are many deeper aspects to addictions, but that doesn’t remove the fact that you are alive, that you have a new day, and you have a choice to choose. How do you think your life would change if you were to “Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today.”?

### We all have those days where we are too busy at home or work that it makes it hard to get to the gym. Or some days we need to have a rest day to let your bodies recover. Well here is a general guide of how many calories you are burning by doing everyday tasks not at the gym. Of course, it differs slightly between men and women, as well as your weight and body physique but this is a general guide.

---

### At home:

House chores can be boring and time-consuming but if we treated it as a style of workout and listen to music while completing these repetitive tasks you may burn just as many calories as you do at the gym. Calories can add up quickly when doing a range of activities for 15 minutes each:

- Washing the dishes (26Cal)
- Sweeping (39Cal)
- Washing windows (34Cal)
- Vacuuming (43Cal)
- Mopping (43Cal)
- Taking out the rubbish (26Cal)
- Cooking (26Cal)
- Putting away groceries (34Cal)
- Watering plants (26Cal)
- Carrying babies/toddlers (34Cal)
- Making the bed (17Cal)

---

### Outdoor chores (15 minutes):

- Chopping wood (85Cal)
- Digging/gardening (68Cal)
- Fruit and vegetable picking (34Cal)
- Watering the garden (9Cal)
- Mowing with a hand mower (85Cal)

---

### Occupation:

If you're tired after a long day of work this may explain why. Here is the rough Calorie loss from one hour of being at work:

- Office work (34Cal)
- Walking on the job in office (154Cal)
- Police officer in squad car (68Cal)
- Baker (204Cal)
- Building (340Cal)
- Farming/Butcher (476Cal)
- Plumbing (170Cal)
- Masseur (204Cal)
- Painter (238Cal)

---

### Self care:

These everyday tiny tasks can burn a small amount of additional energy over 15 minutes:

- Getting dressed (17Cal)
- Eating (9Cal)
- Hairstyling (26Cal)
- Showering (17Cal)
- Brushing teeth (17Cal)
- Sexual activity (9Cal)

So, put the time and effort into the house chores/activities and you may see results too. It is recommended that everyone undertakes 30-60 minutes of moderate intensity exercise at least 5 times a week to prevent health issues. Long term benefits have shown to clearly reduce the development of diabetes, high blood pressure, colon cancer and much more. So look at the positives when doing the housework, it’s not all bad.

**Interesting Fact:**
Did you know that 1 kilocalorie (equivalent to 1 Calorie – with an uppercase “C”- in terms of food) is the amount of energy/heat required to raise the temperature of 1kg water by 1˚C.

### Happiness

A few decades ago a fascinating study was performed[i]. A team of Italian psychologists interviewed some inhabitants from a few Italian Alpine villages that had been somewhat spared from the industrial and technological age. The most striking feature and seemingly ultimate reason for their perceived long-term happiness was that they could seldom distinguish work from play. Even though, they spent much of their days in what we might call work, they didn’t view it as anything different from sitting and drinking with friends, it was just life. Milking the cows held the same value, importance and joy as sitting and playing the guitar. I wonder would happen if we all worked toward taking on this approach to life?

Today is the first day of the new year. I am choosing to write an article at 9am after just having finished my gym session…on New Years Day! This could be viewed a few different ways. #1. I am completely crazy. #2. I have no life. #3. A combination of #1 and #2. #4. This is just living. Undoubtedly most would think I am utterly nuts, but for me this is enjoyable, just as having a big NYE party with my friends was. So, why is it that many folks go out of their way to make a definite distinction between work and play? Between exercise and rest? Why does we always view work and exercise as punishment while rest and play are hailed as rewards? Maybe solving this riddle is the key to our happiness and success.

### Pleasure and Pain

As human beings, we are terrible at knowing what makes us happy. Our decision-making process is tightly based around 2 movements: toward pleasure or away from pain, with the latter of the two being the stronger stimulus. With this knowledge and our earlier observation around punishment and reward, is it any wonder that our heavy reliance on willpower fails to successfully traverse us through the work week or exercise regime? I mean honestly, if I had to face punishment every single day I would probably hate life and give up too. The problem is that we are leaving a life of ‘well-being’ up to choice and as we know when we’re given too much freedom and choice our inherent nature to find the path of least resistance will happily guide us down the road of decisions based on whether we feel up to taking the punishment or not. Pleasure usually reigns supreme. This is a blueprint for disaster.

If we keep segregating our lives into activities of punishment/pain and pleasure/reward we will be in a constant state of guilt, denial and anxiety. There is no simple remedy to this problem, the list and tasks to transform your life to one of joy is long and at times tedious. But at any time, we have the choice to make the shift. To either move from what we have now to something we love or to take ownership of what we currently have and learn to love it. It all starts with deep reflection and questions of ourselves.

### What if you enjoyed it or at least felt good about it?

How would your life change if you didn’t view it as healthy eating and exercise, but simply viewed it as ‘living’? Imagine if going to the gym or going for a run and eating lots of vegetables, lean meats and good fats was not a health kick or something you had to ‘crack down’ on, but simply life. What would life be like if you enjoyed Monday mornings at work? You wouldn’t be in a cycle of abundance and lacking but simply a way of life. There wouldn’t be guilt and shame attached to that celebratory dinner with champagne because that is how you celebrate special occasions and tomorrow when you wake up you get straight back into living. Your whites would be whiter and your brights would be brighter. Isn’t that a life worth fighting for?

**SEO Description:** The glutes are a foundation of all lower body movements. Here's the 5 glute developing movements to target our bodies largest and most powerful muscle group.

### Glute Development Exercises

Gluteus Minimus, Gluteus Medius & Gluteus Maximus. The glutes are a foundation of all lower body movements. This means your ability to jump higher, run faster and squat heavier are all dependent upon your ability to generate force from these muscles. But in this stone age we are spending so much time parked on our behinds. It is causing our glute muscles to stop firing, becoming weak and undertrained, leaving you with a butt as flat as a pancake accompanied by other surrounding muscles taking the workload instead. We need to target our bodies largest and most powerful muscle group by executing these glute developing movements.

---

## 1. Low Bar Back Squat

A Low Bar Squat will force you into more of a forward angle with your torso. In doing so your hips will also shift back more as opposed to other squats like the back or front squat. Also your hamstrings & glutes will have to work harder in this movement. Typically used by Powerlifters to live submaximal weight but also a great variant to work the glutes at a heavy load. Ensure you squeeze your glutes at the top of each rep.

---

## 2. Barbell Hip Thrusts

The Barbell Hip Thrust is up there to be one of the best glute exercises going around. Mainly because you can load up this movement with heavy weight whilst minimizing Quad & Hamstring use, focusing mostly on the glutes at these submaximal loads. Ensure you go through full range of motion reaching full hip extension, use a smooth tempo all whilst focusing on the glutes moving the bar.

---

## 3. Monster Walks

Monster Walks are a great way to work your glutes through abduction of the hip. Most of our movements like squatting and deadlifting use mostly hip extension. Doing Monster walks can be a great warm up or addition to your training program to get your glutes firing!

---

## 4. Bulgarian Lunges (Split Squats)

Also know as the rear foot elevated split squat, Bulgarians are a fantastic single leg variant that really works the glutes! Single leg work is great for hip health as you put your rear leg into a stretched position at the bottom of each rep. Ensure you descend slowly until your knee hits a pad/towel and focus on using your glutes to finish on the way up. At the bottom of the Bulgarian you should have a fairly vertical shin on the front foot.

---

## 5. Single Leg RDL

Another great single leg variation for the glutes! Factoring in balance, core and glute/hamstring development at the same time. Ensure you hold the weight in the hand opposite to the front leg. Push your hips back on the way down & squeeze your glutes at the top.

### So we are 1 month into the year, how are your resolutions going so far? If you are like 92% of people you have probably already lost the fight, but there is hope! Let’s talk about how you can ensure that you Stick to your New Year Resolutions this year!

New Year’s resolutions have become synonymous with failure, so much so that 92% of us will throw in the towel before summer is out. Why? Because resolutions are made for one main reason; to make us feel better about our current situation and hopeful about the year ahead. It’s a temporary motivational tool for the first few weeks of the year as opposed to a goal-oriented-plan for the year. But it’s time to stop with the resolutions and start with the lifestyle solutions.

If you are one of the millions of people into setting resolutions for the year ahead then there is a better than good chance that you probably didn’t exactly hit the ball out of the park this year. There is also a great chance that you didn’t really have any structured plan in place to do so either. So herein lies the question. Are you simply out to feel good by telling yourself and others that you have lofty aspirations or are you genuinely out to achieve something this year?

Let’s analyse both sides of the coin.

---

#### Option #1: Feel good New Year resolutions.

Tasks include:
- Make a laundry list of everything you would like to have done or done better this year.
- Add to this list any new things that you would like to do next year.
- Cull this list down to your top 5.
- Now do a second cull down to the 3 that sound the most impressive in conversation. Done!

There’s nothing further to do now with option #1 seeing as they are only temporary feel good devices. Just kick back, keep doing what you’re doing, but have these 3 ready for the next BBQ chit chat.

---

#### Option #2: Goal-oriented plan for achievement.

This one is a little more involved because it requires actual work and lots of it.

Tasks include:
- Make a laundry list of everything you would like to have done or done better this year.
- Add to this list any new things that you would like to do next year.
- Next to each of these things write WHY you want to achieve them next year.
- Next to that, write what it will feel like if you did achieve them this year.
- Based on those feelings order them from most inspiring to least inspiring.
- Your top 3 are your focus. The rest can remain on a separate list but your top 3, once achieved, are going to massively improve your feeling on how your year and life transpires. These are your focus and everything else on the list must be de-prioritized to achieve these three.
- Get crystal clear on these goals by making them SMART. Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Rewarding and Timed.
- Attach more emotion and inspiration to them by picturing and documenting your life during and after their realization.
- Draw out a timeline from their ‘due date’ to today. Work backwards entering in milestones and mini-stones of achievement to help track progress.
- Schedule and plan your days and weeks with tasks that push you toward those goals.
- Use that honeymoon motivation period to build habits based around these tasks, so that when you don’t feel like working toward them you will anyway.
- Ready, set, GO!

---

As you can see, the 2nd option is rather in depth compared with the first, which is most likely the reason behind the majority opting for the former. However, if you are keen to become part of the Elite 8% of achievers then hold on tight. You will be fighting against the grain, you will be fighting against most everybody else. It won’t be easy, if it was easy then everybody would be doing it.

**SEO Title:** The most underrated training style (5x5 workout)

**SEO Description:** The 5×5 is a very simple style of weight training. This blog will explain about 5x5 workout and and why is it beneficial for you.

## What is the 5×5?

The 5×5 is a very simple style of weight training. As the name presents, the meaning behind the name is to perform 5 reps of a given weight (with a weight you could do 6 or ~7 maybe) and do this for a total of 5 sets. While it can be performed on many exercises, the 5×5 is especially advantageous when it comes to compound exercises such as the deadlift, squat and bench press. Movements like the leg press work well too, but staying away from putting heavy weight on the elbow for instance to perform tricep movements, may be a safe idea.

## Why is it beneficial?

Training in a low rep range (2-4 reps compared to the average 10-12) for the average weightlifter will result in a different outcome progress wise. Around 12 repetitions of a weight is very great for breaking down muscle fibers and having them slowly grow from repeated training in this fashion, e.g. Bodybuilding. Yet in order to receive the most progress possible when it comes to building mass, one must also become stronger. This is important because it would be more beneficial for the same identical person to be lifting 12kg dumbbells with good form, rather than 8kg dumbbells with good form. This scenario can very much be true as anyone that structures their training around becoming stronger at the same time as building mass, will just be a slightly stronger version of themselves in a few weeks or months. The 5×5 shines in this area as you it seems to find a sweet spot between powerlifting and bodybuilding rep ranges, and can easily be done at the start of a workout before moving onto the rest of the mass building styled workout.

Another benefit of following a program such as this is to keep yourself accountable for getting in the amount of workout volume that you had wanted to perform. With set targets and a easy to track goal or view of the improvements you are making (as you slowly start to be able to rep heavier weight for the 5 reps) it can be very good motivational wise to see what the 5×5 can do for you. Of course there is many routines out there to follow and it is worth trying out a range of them to see how your body responds, but the 5×5 is just a simple one to follow but greatly beneficial.

## Anywhere during one’s fitness journey, this question will eventually come to mind. Whether you’re plotting your workouts within your work schedule or finding what works best for you, we’re here to find out how time affects your body’s response to exercise.

It’s quite well known that almost every aspect of our physiology and metabolism is dictated by the circadian clock,” says Gad Asher of the Department of Biomolecular Sciences at the Weizmann Institute of Science. A person’s circadian rhythm includes physical, mental, and behavioural changes that follow a 24-hour cycle in response to light and darkness.

Senior author of another recent paper that has shown similar findings, out of the Center for Epigenetics and Metabolism at the University of California, Paolo Sassone-Corsi adds “Circadian rhythms dominate everything we do”. He goes on to say, “Previous studies from our lab have suggested that at least 50% of our metabolism is circadian, and 50% of the metabolites in our body oscillate based on the circadian cycle. It makes sense that exercise would be one of the things that’s impacted.”

## Morning vs. Evening

Studies have shown that morning exercise initiates gene programs in the muscle cells, making them more effective and better capable of metabolising sugar and fat while evening exercise, on the other hand, increases whole body energy expenditure for an extended period of time.

So, there isn’t a better time to exercise as both have different effects in the body. So how might we be able to use these to our advantage?

## Morning workouts

Since morning exercise increases the ability of muscle cells to metabolise sugar and fat, plotting workouts in the morning would be beneficial for people who may be severely overweight or those who are type 2 diabetes.

## Evening workouts

Based on the research shown above, evening workouts were associated with increased energy expenditure, which affects how many calories we burn daily. But we may take such information lightly as it all depends on a person’s energy levels throughout the day, the amount of sleep they get, as well as food intake to fuel them for a workout.

## Bottomline

There isn’t a best time for a workout. The different times of the day may have different effects to the muscles but best way to measure its effectivity is how much effort is put into a workout which means fuel and recovery will come into play. 

What matters most is finding the best workout regime that fits your schedule.

**SEO Description:** The following abdominal exercises are the best for building abdominal strength and decreasing back pain.

### Abdominal Strength Exercises for Decreasing Back Pain

Abdominal strength is a key to decreasing back pain, but how do you build that strength when you have back issues?

Abdominal exercises should:

- Build strength and shape to your lower stomach
- Help support the lower spine
- Work in tandem with the pelvic floor
- Naturally recruit deep and intermediate abdominals
- Assist food digestion
- Improve breathing efficiency

Unfortunately, there are a few abdominal exercises that can increase or cause back pain, such as sit-ups, crunches, and some versions of plank exercises. These exercises can cause unnecessary pressure against the spine and lower body organs.

The following abdominal exercises are the best for building abdominal strength and decreasing back pain.

#### Dead Bug

*Allows movement of hips and arms without moving the spine*

1. Lie flat on your back with arms extended towards the ceiling;
2. Bring knees up until the hips are at 90 degrees – keeping the knees bent;
3. Exhale hard to bring the rib cage down and make the whole back rest on the floor;
4. Extend one foot by straightening the hips and knee and bring it slightly above the ground;
5. Avoid arching the back – keep the lower back firmly on the floor, and
6. Slowly bend the leg and return it to the starting position, repeating the cycle for each leg.

#### Leg Flutters

*Activates the lower abdominal muscles placing less pressure on the spine.*

1. Lie flat on the back keeping the legs straight;
2. Place both arms under your butt and lift the legs until the hips are at a 90-degree angle;
3. Slowly bring one leg down until the heels almost touch the floor, and then raise it as you lower the other foot, and
4. Repeat until you have completed as many as you can.

#### Bird Dog

*Activates the entire core – abdominals, lower back, and gluteus muscles. The bird dog requires a little coordination.*

1. Kneel on the floor and place hands on the floor shoulder-width apart;
2. Keep the back straight and tighten the abdominal muscles;
3. Extend one arm straight out in front of you and simultaneously extend the opposite leg until it’s aligned with the hips and the back – hold position for 5 to 10 seconds;
4. Slowly lower the arm and leg to the starting position, and
5. Complete repetitions for one side then switch sides and do the same number of reps.

#### Reverse Curl Up

*Helps control the lower abdomen and support the low lumbar spine.*

1. Push your lower back against the floor during each repetition, you should not be able to put your hands under your back;
2. Do not let your feet come up during the movement, keep knees flexed and close to your glutes;
3. Keep your head down and bring knees towards your head, head doesn’t move towards your knees,
4. Avoid working your hip flexors, do not let your legs come past perpendicular to the floor on the way down.

Reverse curls ups will also aid good breathing, rather than accentuating bad breathing patterns.

#### Exercise Ball Crunches

*These do not put any pressure on the spine.*

1. Lay on an exercise ball, resting the body on it from the upper buttock to the middle back;
2. Keep the knees bent and place your hands behind the head;
3. Lower the head and shoulders as low as you can, tighten the abdominal muscles and raise the upper torso, and
4. Lower the upper torso again and repeat the movement.

Set a timer for 30 seconds for each exercise and repeat 3 times. Doing these exercises consistently will increase core muscle strength without causing lower back pain. With time, existing back pain could disappear.

## WORK IS THE KEY

Every morning we wake up and are faced with the decision of how we are going to walk into the world, how we are going to choose to live, how we are going to use our energy. Einstein said, “work is the only thing that gives substance to life”. At first, this statement can sound shallow if we think about the idea of work in the way many of us hear it being used day to day. But when you think of ‘work’ as the expenditure of energy and focus towards a meaningful goal, this quote becomes truth. Your current goal may be to lose 15kgs, to build a closer relationship with your partner, to discover your full potential, or to overcome your fears that have been holding you back from living a full life. Imagine how your life would change if you committed to “work as hard as you possibly could on one thing and see what happens” (Jordan Peterson). Now that type of work would indeed give substance to your life, and not only your life but the lives of those around you. So when you wake up tomorrow morning and life asks you how you are going to choose to live, I challenge you to ignore the easy path of mediocrity and fuel your life with substance and meaning by doing the hard work and watch how your life changes.

“Faith will get you to a point. Luck will get you to a point. But to achieve the kind of success you dream about, you need to WORK. There are no shortcuts, you can’t cheat life, just get to work and don’t stop until you reach your highest potential.” – **Denzel Washington**

“Success isn’t always about greatness. It’s about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come.” – **Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson**

“90% of success is just showing up. You’re not going to feel perfect everyday. Get there and start working.” – **Joe Rogan**

“If you don’t find the time, if you don’t do the work, you don’t get the results.” – **Arnold Schwarzenegger**

### Squatting parallel or Squatting deep…

We see a variety of squats in the gym every day! We see boxes, bands, wide stances, narrow stances, no lock outs, heels elevated & the list goes on and on. But when it comes to squatting variables, a common one is the depth.

A [squat](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/training/13-different-squats-for-stronger-legs) is a compound, multi joint, full body exercise that engages most of the lower body. The motion will have you bend at the knees, hinge at the hip whilst keeping the back flat & torso upright. Whether its performed with bodyweight, with a dumbbell, kettlebell or barbell… It’s certainly a staple of most training programs. In saying that, we should want to get the most out of this exercise.

---

### Should I squat more weight and reduce my squat depth or should I squat less weight but focus on full range of motion?

I believe we should all squat past parallel (unless an injury prevents) and do this as heavy as practical. I’m going to give you a few reasons why.

The deeper you squat; greater activation of the posterior chain occurs. Essentially the glutes & hamstrings will work a lot harder the further you go down. When the glutes & hamstrings muscles are stretched further you will, in turn, get greater activation when compared to a parallel squat.

By using more of our posterior chain, we will then take some of the stress off the knees. An analysis by Hartmann in 2013 showed us that full depth squats had less stress on the knee joint & less risk of injury when compared to partial range squats. It also showed us that the highest compressive force on the knee is at 90 degrees.

*"Based on biomechanical calculations and measurements of cadaver knee joints, the highest retropatellar compressive forces and stresses can be seen at 90°. With increasing flexion, the wrapping effect contributes to an enhanced load distribution and enhanced force transfer with lower retropatellar compressive forces."*

*"Provided that technique is learned accurately under expert supervision and with progressive training loads, the deep squat presents an effective training exercise for protection against injuries and strengthening of the lower extremity. Contrary to commonly voiced concern, deep squats do not contribute increased risk of injury to passive tissues."*

Full squats will also transfer into a better vertical jump. A Study in 2012 showed that a 10 week deep squat program led to an 8% increase in the vertical jump whereas the partial squat group experienced no increase in the vertical jump.

### The summary of Squatting parallel or Squatting

Transfer into a better vertical jump (the vertical jump is a common test to measure/test explosive power in a lot of sports). Hopefully this is enough to convince you to get that little bit lower in your squats!

## Exercise in the Fat Burning Zone to shred belly fat

---

## Ideal Heart Rate for Fat Burning

When your heart rate is between 60-70% of your maximum, your body is in peek fat burning mode, so the goal of any exercise if the goal is fat loss, in this case walking, is to ensure that you are sitting in that Goldilocks zone of 60-70%.

Here is how you can calculate what your fat burning heart rate zone is:

To find your maximum heart rate, minus your age from 220.

Eg, if you are 29 years old, 220-29 = 191

So 191 is my maximum heart rate, now I need to calculate the 60-70% fat burning zone from that 191, which turns out to be 114-133 Beats per minute.

You might be thinking, “will I burn more fat if I can increase my heart rate higher than trying to exercise in the fat burning zone?” Well, in those higher heart rate zones your body looks for sugar and carbohydrate stores for energy, whereas when you are in the 60-70% zone, about 85% of the calories you will burn come from your fat stores, with the other 15% from carbs and protein.

The tricky part is monitoring your heart rate while you are walking or exercising to ensure you are in the fat burning zone. So you will need to get yourself a smartwatch (Heart rate monitor) which will tell you your average heart rate over the course of your workout.

---

## Ideal Duration for Fat Burning

When you do a shorter workout, your body will generally use more sugar and carbohydrate stores, but because those energy stores don’t last very long, you want to aim to train a little bit longer to get your body to burn through all the sugar and carbs so that it can begin to target your fat stores. So you ideally want to aim for a longer workout, around 45 minutes or longer.

---

## Exercise Variation to Trigger Fat Burning

Although walking or exercising at 60-70% HR will get you into fat burning mode, it will not do a lot for your strength or lean muscle. When your body has higher levels of lean muscle tissue you burn more calories because your body requires more energy to fuel and move those muscles. So we do recommend including some resistance training, to help build your strength and lean muscle, so that when you are doing the low-intensity exercise/walking your body will burn even more calories because it needs more energy and it is able to train for longer because you have built up your muscular strength and endurance.

So try alternating your workouts, if you like to train in the gym then every second workout try a 45-minute brisk walk so that you exercise in the fat burning zone (60-70% HR) and see how your body begins to transform.

## Everyone loves to train chest. We love it, you love it, your grandma and her dog loves it. There’s a reason why Mondays are known as “International Chest Day”. But many of us have struggled to grow our chest and triceps.
Walk into any gym and you’ll see those people who are constantly training chest. I mean constantly – every damn time you see them. Yet what do you notice about most of them? They have the chest development of a pre-pubescent boy. You’ll see them perform ten variations of the same exercise, done nearly every day. It seems like they’ve tried everything to get their chest and triceps to grow, except *doing the right thing.*
Let’s fix that.
It’s not just about what exercises you do, but *how* you perform them. If you can improve the quality of each rep performed, you’ll improve the quality of muscle development.

---

## Two fantastic methods that you can use to induce muscle growth to grow your chest and triceps:

1. Increasing Time Under Tension (TUT)
2. Metabolic stress

In other words, do the exercise/reps for a longer period of time, and make the muscles *burn, a lot.
If you’re not used to manipulating your tempo and increasing TUT, then start off by picking a weight roughly 70% of what you would normally use. What you would do is then perform your reps a lot slower than you normally would. Start taking anywhere from 5-7 seconds, and increase it from there if you’re truly insane. Because the reps are much slower, your muscles are going to be working a lot harder – hence the lighter weight. If your goal is to build muscle, then this is a great way to force it grow.
So for a dumbbell bench press for example, you might take 3 seconds to lower the weight, pause at the bottom for 1 second, take 2 seconds to push the weight up, and hold it at the top for 1 more second. Do a complete set of 8-12 reps at that tempo and tell me that your chest doesn’t feel like it’s on fire. So to write this down on paper you would write the tempo as 3121.
TUT will naturally produce more metabolic stress on the muscle, but you can further increase it by incorporating stretches and pauses during your set. Similar to TUT, it’ll mean that you’re slowing your overall reps down, but you are purposely focusing on the end range of motion of the exercise.
If that doesn’t sound fun to you, then you could go the simple route and just incorporate higher-reps (15-25+).
Using the dumbbell chest fly as an example, you would lower the dumbbells until you get to the very bottom and feel the stretch in your pecs. Instead of coming up straight away, you’ll hold it there for 2-3 seconds, bring it up, and then at the very top squeeze the dumbbells together as hard as you can for another 1-2 seconds to help add to the muscle contraction of your pecs. This will produce an insane pump in your chest and will cause muscle damage and promote muscle growth like no other!
You can apply these two methods to any exercise out there, but since we’re talking about your chest here, let’s put it all together for a solid workout. Throw in a few sets of shoulders and triceps at the end and you’ll have an upper body day that’ll leave you feeling awesome! Remember it’s not always about how many exercises you do, but how you perform them.

## Workout Plan:

| Exercise                | Sets | Reps  | Tempo | Rest Between Sets (minutes) |
|-------------------------|------|-------|-------|------------------------------|
| A1. Bench Press         | 6    | 6     | 2010  | 3                            |

**SEO Title:** The Split Squat Could Be Your Answer

**SEO Description:** What if we have a situation where we can't do a squat but still want to get the benefits of a squat? A split squat could be the answer. Find out more!

The squat is regarded as the king of all exercises and a very good exercise. It is a compound movement (ie. an exercise that uses two or more different joints to engage muscle groups) that trains the glutes, quadriceps, hamstrings, core and can produce (in conjunction with diet) rapid strength and body composition improvements in both men and women. It is a highly functional movement that can assist with a range of daily activities.

However not everyone can perform a squat whilst ensuring our joints are in the correct position to get the most out of the squat.

As we get older, a lot of us lose our ability to squat the way we did when we were younger. Visualise a healthy toddler picking something off the ground – they squat down with pretty much perfect form. As we get older, work, injuries and sometimes laziness means we’ll bend at the hips to pick things up off the ground (unless it’s heavy when we may bend our legs).

Modern day lifestyle can also contribute to our inability to squat. Working in jobs where we are in a seated position for 8+ hours a day shortens the hip flexor muscles and lengthens the glutes. This makes the glutes weak and usually results in an anterior (forward) rotation of the hip. When the hip is in this position, tightness in the hips is usually the result which restricts hip mobility when attempting to squat.

The type of footwear we regularly wear has an influence on the range in the ankle. The soleus muscle which sits below the gastrocnemius (large calf muscle) and just above the achilles can also tighten up with years of neglect to the type of footwear worn.

---

### So, what if we have a situation where we have tight hips and restricted ankle joints but still want to get the benefits of a squat?

---

### A split squat could be the answer.

---

This is a fantastic exercise that targets the same muscle groups and is one that is easier to get into the correct position than the squat. The split squat is also a unilateral movement which means it is performed by one limb at a time. This allows you to easily identify strength imbalances between the right and left side.

There are a number of variations – both feet can be on the ground but for those who are a little more advanced, elevating either the front or back foot on a step or block will take this exercise to a new level. You can use your own body weight, a barbell or dumbbells.

The split squat is also an excellent alternative to a traditional squat for those who have back or spine issues. When doing a split squat, you use lighter weights than what you would use when performing a traditional squat. This means less spinal compression from the weight.

Use the split squat as your go-to exercise to build and train your legs whilst continuing to work on the issues preventing you from performing a normal squat using just your bodyweight such as hip and ankle mobility.

Famous author Zig Ziglar once famously remarked,

‘People don’t tend to wander around and then find themselves at the top of Mount Everest’.

Creating fitness goals and setting them can seem tedious but is the absolute KEY to your success! You need to have a step-by-step process of achieving your major goal; this step-by-step process removes any fear and uncertainty that you may have. So crush your fitness goals after reading this perfect plan.

Goals are especially powerful if they are time-based, measurable and concrete. This means they need to have a specific start and finish date, goals need to be measured, for example losing 5% body fat in 10 weeks – and it needs to be either written in a journal, covered on the fridge or pinup board or written as the home screen for your phone.

Tell your friends, family and coworkers about your goals. Not only for support but also going public will mean you are more likely to stick to your plan. Accountability is key!

Those who end up not only achieving their goals but also maintaining their goals remind themselves of the benefits associated with achieving their goals. For example, remind yourself, why will your life be better after achieving your goal? Finally feeling unashamed of your body when in a swimsuit or naked.

Don’t focus on how failure to change will result in having to endure the negative aspects of your current situation.

You will be creating sub goals and for each of your sub goals achieved it will put you a step closer towards achieving your overall goal.

You will be rewarded for each sub goal but it can never conflict and contradict with the overall goal itself, i.e. going on an ice cream and pizza binge because you have had a good week of healthy eating won’t help you in achieving your goal. Try getting a massage instead something that feels good and will also benefit you.

## Create the Perfect Plan

### Step 1 – What is your overall goal?

Write it down now! What do you want to achieve with your fitness?

Do not move on until you have written this down!

Example: I want to lose 12kg in 12 weeks.

---

### Step 2 – Create a step-by-step plan and split your overall goal into sub-goals.

Each goal needs to be concrete, measurable, realistic and time-based.

Create 3-4 sub-goals

- My first sub goal is to…
- I believe that I can achieve this goal because…
- To achieve this sub-goal I will…
- This will be achieved by the following date…
- My reward for achieving this goal will be…

Write these out now for all of your sub-goals. Don’t move on until you have done this!

Example:

- My first sub goal is to start cooking 3 x per week
- I believe that I can achieve this goal because I will plan out each of my meals and have a shopping list ready
- To achieve this sub-goal I will need to be organised
- This will be achieved by the following date…
- My reward for achieving this goal will be to go to the movies at the end of the 12 weeks

---

### Step 3 - What are the benefits of achieving your overall goal?

List 3 important benefits focusing on how much better your life will be for you and those around you. Focus on enjoying the benefits of your desired future rather than the negative aspects of your current situation.

- I am sick of feeling tired all the time, I want to feel energetic and full of energy
- I want to feel confident around my partner and friends when I’m in my swimsuit
- I want to do something for myself and stop giving excuses

---

### Step 4 – Go public!

Accountability is the KEY to succeeding with your overall goal and sub-goals. Who are you going to tell? Maybe it is your friends, family and/or colleagues.

Once you express that you are going to achieve something to those nearest and dearest to you, you have made the concrete choice to obtain that goal and you will unlock the key to motivation.

## What is RED-S?

Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport, “RED-S” or simply “RED-S” is a clinically defined syndrome referring to the impairment of physiological function caused by a deficit in a person’s **energy intake** relative to the **energy required** to maintain optimal health, homeostasis, growth, the activities of daily living, and sport.  

Being in this state of relative deficit is often also referred to as being in a state of low energy availability (LEA). In this state, there is a lower than required amount of energy for the body’s normal physiological functions.

This can have a variety of health consequences including:  

- Altered metabolic function
- Menstrual disturbances and amenorrhea (loss of period)
- [Amenorrheic athletes have 2 to 4 times greater risk for a stress fracture](https://doi.org/10.2165/00007256-199928020-00004)
- Impaired bone health (increased osteoporosis risk)
- Reductions in immune system function
- Reduced protein synthesis (ie for muscles and tendons)
- Impacts on cardiovascular health

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has developed two RED-S models. This first one shows 10 health consequences linked to RED-S:

## Who is at risk of RED-S?

Active men or women with disordered eating or with an eating disorder are at risk.

**Disordered eating** (DE) is a term that refers to a range of irregular eating behaviors but does not fit the full criteria to be diagnosed as a specific eating disorder.  

DE can include (but isn’t limited to) things like:  

- Chronic restrictive eating
- Excessive fasting
- Food-related anxiety
- Skipping meals
- Restricting entire food groups
- Negative preoccupation with food
- Negative preoccupation with weight and body image
- Misuse of laxatives or diuretics

**Eating disorders** (ie...)

# Holiday Workout Survival Guide

Sticking to your workout regimen on a holiday break is usually one of the challenges we face and we can all relate to. Quit and avoid the regret cycle and read our a survival guide on how you can stick and plan your holiday workout program better and more effectively.

## Content

As another holiday season rolls around, we may find ourselves out of sync with our normal routines. In particular, our training patterns are likely to be one of the first affected. The good news is, this doesn’t have to hinder our progress. On the contrary, we should be leveraging our holidays to benefit our training!

---

## What are your goals?

The best way for you to train on holidays will vary depending on your position leading into the break. With this, it’s crucial to consider your desired outcome and goals. The approach for the fitness newbie just starting out will differ to the seasoned athlete who is in the middle of a competitive season.

### To simplify this, you can group yourself into one of two categories:

1. You’re approaching a deadline, and a variation to training may hinder your outcomes.

You might put yourself in this group if you have a competition or event coming up that is during or directly following the holiday period.

---

2. Time is less of an issue.

You’ll fall into this group if you can afford to be less strict with your training - this is what holidays are for, right?

Once you know where you are, you can plot a course to where you are going. The following options and tips can be chosen to best suit your goals.

---

## Consider Your Program

Will holidays fall in the middle of an important training block, or can you adjust your training to use the holidays as a deload or complete rest?

If you’re only getting away for a few days, it might be best to take a complete rest! This is the whole point of holidays after all - relax, and come back fresh!

If you’re looking to get some training in, there are plenty of different options that can be utilized.

---

## Calisthenics and Bodyweight Workouts

Depending on your holiday location, you may have access to bars, park benches, hills, stairs, or other equipment. Get creative!

If it suits your goal, this type of training can be great for a mental and physical break, allowing you to return home ready to train hard!

The body has an amazing ability to adapt to the physiological demands placed upon it. The process of super-compensation is key to improving our physical capabilities whether that is strength, speed or aerobic capacity!

If we look at strength training more specifically, the process of breaking down muscle tissue sends the body into a period of performance decrement or weakness. With proper recovery, nutrition and rest the body super-compensates, meaning performance (in this circumstance strength) increases beyond its initial baseline! Meaning we are able to do and achieve more that we would have previously.

## There are 4 main phases to this theory which will be unpacked below:

### Phase 1

Phase 1 involves the training stimulus and the application of training load upon the athlete. In this phase it is very important that the load is suitable for the athlete or individual. Loads that are well beyond the individual’s capabilities or inappropriate intensities will likely result in difficulty returning the athlete to their base level of fitness. On the flip side, training that is too easy for the athlete will result in minimal or non-training adaptation.

---

### Phase 2

Phase 2 involves recovery from training stimulus! The only way in which this process works is when athletes are well recovered, if a further training stimulus is applied without complete recovery from the previous session then the individual risks missing the benefits of adaptation. If this occurs on an ongoing basis the individual may see a gradual decline in performance with repeated exposure to training whilst under recovering.

---

### Phase 3

Phase 3 is the supercompensation phase! In this component of the theory, the athlete enters a window of improved performance following training and proper recovery producing a wavelike graph that depicts a progressive supercompensation positive slop.

---

### Detraining phase

If an athlete enters a phase of training that is too easy or has an extended lay-off period after the initial stimulus, this can result in a decline in performance (supercompensation negative slop). This phase is referred to as the detraining phase.

---

So, what can we take from all this? Well, there is an inherent need for coaches or individuals to assess their own schedules in order to develop programs that will optimize training loads to maximize supercompensation.

Nutrition is also a big factor ensuring adequate macronutrients from protein for muscle repair, replenishment of glycogen stores through carbohydrates, intake of small amounts of healthy unsaturated fats and micronutrients from either supplementation or plenty of vegetables and fresh fruit, adequate hydration and sleep. All of these factors will play an important role in recovery between sessions!

Keeping a journal or logbook and recording your nutrition and training is a great start, you may even be able to utilize your activity monitor, apple watch or GPS to assess how you are responding to your own training plans.

# Isolated Movements vs Compound Movements

We will discuss the distinction and advantages of isolated movements and compound movements.

---

## Content

### When training

When training, you have probably heard the two types of movements – isolation and compound movements for targeting different muscle groups for your exercise. Both compound and isolation exercises are important depending on your workout regimen.

### What are compound movements?

Compound movements are exercises that focus on working multiple muscles or muscle groups at one time. If you want to focus on increasing your strength or improving athletic performance, compound exercises are a great way to start.

A perfect example of compound exercise would be deadlifts. Deadlifts target your muscles in the following areas:
- Forearms
- Lats
- Glutes
- Hamstrings
- Core
- Upper-, mid-, and lower back

### Compound Movement Pros

- Decreases the risk of injury
- Burns a lot of calories
- Allows you to get in an effective workout
- Shows significant results of toning and strength
- Keeps your heart rate up

### Compound Movement Cons

- Can be tricky when you have damaged muscles
- Can result in injury when lifting too heavy weights with bad form

### What are isolation movements?

Isolation exercises are those that work only a muscle or muscle group at one time. These exercises are great for beginners, but it is important to balance your exercise by training the opposing muscle group as well.

A great example of an isolation exercise is the sit-up, which focuses on toning and strengthening your core.

### Isolation Movement Pros

- Can isolate areas you specifically want to bulk up
- Can improve strength in specific muscles
- Best for rehabilitation from an injury
- Corrects muscle imbalance

### Isolation Movement Cons

- Isolation exercises require more variation
- Difficu...

### What is Blood Circulation?
Blood circulation occurs in the circulatory system and is basically the movement of blood throughout the body carrying oxygen, nutrients, and hormones to cells, and removing waste products. Blood transports carbon dioxide to the lungs for exhalation and picks up oxygen through the network of arteries, veins, and capillaries. The blood collects food nutrients from the small intestine and transports them to every cell in the body.

### But why is this important and how does good blood flow affect athletic performance?
During exercise, there is a transportation of oxygen from the lungs to the tissue and delivery of metabolically produced CO2 to the lungs for expiration. It is important to adopt [good breathing techniques](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/breathing-techniques-for-training) during training so good circulation is observed. Improving blood flow allows more oxygen to reach your muscles, which means that your workout will be more effective and last longer and decrease possible fatigue. As you work out, the oxygen that enters your muscles transforms the available glucose into ATP, giving your body the energy it needs to finish your workout.

### How can one improve Blood circulation?
1. Drink water
   Drinking water aids in digestion and it helps carry nutrients and oxygen to our cells. According to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, the adequate daily fluid intake is about 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) of fluids for men and 11.5 cups (2.7 liters) of fluids a day for women.

2. Stretch
   Stretching helps increase blood flow to your body’s tissues and organs. You can incorporate stretching in your daily routine by allotting a few minutes for it early in the morning or before and after a workout.

3. Exercise
   Exercise can help boost circulation as well as improve mental health. A few minutes of exercises like walking, running, and the like can be just as effective.

4. Manage Stress
   Heightened stress can cause an increase in blood pressure and can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.

5. Include Omega-3 Fatty Acids
   Foods containing Omega-3 fatty acids are proven to promote cardiovascular health and improve circulation.

### The role of AAKG in improving blood circulation
Arginine-alpha-ketoglutarate, also known as AAKG, boosts nitric oxide production, which causes blood vessels to dilate and improve blood flow to the muscles. When performing resistance training, the blood supply to the working muscles is allegedly improved by the AAKG supplement, leading to greater muscle strength than with exercise alone. Learn more about the [benefits of AAKG](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/supplements/aakg-what-is-it-and-what-are-the-benefits) in our previous article.

**SEO Title:** Progressive Overload

**SEO Description:** Strength training uses progressive overload. Making your workouts harder over time stresses your musculoskeletal and neurological systems. This weightlifting progression builds strength, muscle, and endurance.

## Content

Strength training uses progressive overload. Making your workouts harder over time stresses your musculoskeletal and neurological systems. This weightlifting progression builds strength, muscle, and endurance. Progressive overload can be used with push-ups, bicep curls, deadlifts, bench presses, and squats. This works for dumbbell, barbell, and bodyweight workouts.

Training with Progressive Overload:

## 4 POT Principles

Progressive overload training has four principles:

1. **Keep form**: Choose a weight you can lift properly before beginning strength training. Increase the workout's intensity just when you can move the weight with good technique.

2. **Make little changes**: Change a lift's complexity gradually to avoid injury. Shift the weight before changing repetitions or sets to make deadlifts harder. Increasing weight and repetitions concurrently may strain your body.

3. **Repeat and set**: Make sure you can do the recommended repetitions and sets with your current weight before adding more. Add weight, a hold, or less rest time when you can finish repetitions and sets.

4. **Track workouts**: Remember your weight, repetitions, and sets by keeping track of your workouts. Tracking your progress will help you adjust next week.

## Progressive Overload Techniques

There are various techniques to increase weightlifting intensity. Progressive overload includes:

- **Weight up**: Progressive overload is achieved by lifting larger weights each week while preserving form. Only when you can lift the new weight with the same amount of reps as previously should you increase it. If you can squat 100 kgs in one week, try 105 the next. You can add 2.5, 5, or 10 kgs to a lift.

- **Repeat**: Reps boost volume. Increase repetitions to muscle failure without losing form. Aim for 3 to 8 reps and sometimes reach your 1RM to increase strength (one rep max, the maximum amount of weight you can lift for one rep). For muscular hypertrophy, do 10 to 15 reps.

- **More sets**: Increase repetitions, then sets to improve training volume. 5 to 7 sets per lift is recommended. To push your muscles, lift heavier weights. Reduce rest time.

- **Resting less**: Between sets might boost metabolic efficiency and feed your workout with fat. Try resting for 1.5 minutes between sets. This also speeds up the workout. Resting for a few minutes isn't suggested for bigger lifts or lifts around your 1RM because it takes longer to recover.

- **Increase your workouts**: If you wish to focus on a muscle group, add extra resistance workouts that target that group. If you want stronger arms, add a weekly upper-body workout. Don't train the same muscle group numerous days in a row without proper recovery.

- **Amplify**: To make an exercise harder, lower your lifting pace, expand the range of motion, or add a hold. If you're squatting, slow down or pause at the bottom. Holds enhance muscular tension, which builds endurance.

## Progressive overload training's limitations

1. **Nonlinear progressive overload**: Overtraining can lead to plateaus and injuries. Plateaus are normal times when you retain your strength and don't improve with demanding routines. Rethink improvement. Instead of lifting a larger weight, try doing more reps or going slower. To make strength training tougher, add additional resistance exercises or start a new program.

2. **Overtraining**: Challenge yourself weekly. To minimize overtraining and injuries, advance carefully, end a workout early if necessary, and schedule recuperation time and rest days.

### How strong is your core?

Building core strength and stability is something we all should be doing if we want to improve our overall health, feel better, and be prepared in case of injury. A strong core is also essential for heavy lifting, sports, and everyday tasks like picking up your kids or carrying groceries.

---

## The core is like the foundation of a house — everything is built on this area of your body.

If you have weak or unstable abs, lower back, and glutes, you will experience problems in other parts of your body. The best way to build core strength and stability is through functional movements that challenge your body in multiple planes of motion: side planks, Russian twists, and press-ups are all great [exercises that work your whole body while also improving core strength.](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/training/our-7-favourite-exercises-to-get-massive-strong-abs?_pos=3&_sid=950fcfeb9&_ss=r)

---

## Weak core muscles can lead to poor posture and back pain.

---

### What Is a Strong Core?

A strong core generates sufficient strength in all the muscles that support your spine and pelvis while performing functional movement patterns such as walking, bending over, lifting objects, etc. A strong core is essential for athletes and non-athletes because it helps prevent injury during daily activities.

### The different core muscles

The core is the area of your body that includes your chest, back, and abdomen. A strong core helps you maintain balance, do your daily activities quickly, and prevent injury. The core comprises many muscles that support and stabilize your spine. When these muscles work together, they can help you produce force in your upper and lower body.

---

### The core muscles are:

- **Transversus abdominis** – this muscle wraps around the waist like an apron. It helps to compress the abdomen to assist with breathing, coughing, and sneezing.
- **Rectus abdominis** – this muscle runs vertically along the front of the abdomen and contributes to flexion and rotation at the spine and pelvis.
- **Obliques** – these muscles run diagonally from one ribcage to another. They assist with lateral flexion at the spine and pelvis (side bends).
- **Erector spinae** – this group of muscles lies on either side of the spine and extends from the pelvis to the skull. It supports the extension of vertebrae.

---

## There are different ways to train your core, depending on your fitness needs and goals.

---

Here are four types of workouts that will help you strengthen your core:

1. **Sit-ups**

Sit-ups are one of the most common exercises for strengthening your core. Unfortunately, they're also one of the easiest to do wrong, which can cause injury if you don't know [how to do them correctly.](https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-exercise/sit-ups-vs-crunches#situps)

2. **Crunches**

Crunches are another great exercise to strengthen your core. Unfortunately, they're also easy to do wrong, so follow instructions carefully when performing this exercise.

3. **Planks or Side Planks**

Planks and side planks work your entire body, including your core, abs, and back muscles. These exercises can help improve overall strength and stability in your entire body and [reduce lower back pain.](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/training/best-and-worst-ab-exercises-when-you-have-back-pain?_pos=8&_sid=950fcfeb9&_ss=r)

4. **Lateral Walkouts**

Lateral walkouts strengthen your hip abductors (muscles on the sides of your hips) and gluteus medius (one of the main hip stabilizing muscles). These muscles help keep your hips stable while walking or running, so strengthening them makes it easier for you to perform any activity without injuring yourself by overloading these areas due to weakness or poor balance control.

It's a good thing that your core strength is largely trainable. You can use many techniques to build up those stabilizing muscles, some of which target the deep core (the one that really drives movement) and some of which target the superficial core.

We need to learn how to strengthen our core because our ability to control stability and balance in a variety of situations helps keep our bodies healthy and strong. But developing strong core strength and a solid sense of balance is also incredibly vital for virtually all activities of daily living.

## Zone 2 Heart Rate Training

Zone 2 heart rate training is a highly effective and sustainable way to improve cardiovascular health, increase endurance, burn fat, reduce the risk of injury, improve athletic performance, decrease stress levels, manage chronic health conditions, improve cognitive function, and is suitable for people of all fitness levels.

---

## Content

## If you're looking for a way to improve your cardiovascular health, increase endurance, and burn fat, zone 2 heart rate training may be the answer. Zone 2 training has been gaining popularity in recent years as a more effective and sustainable alternative to high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and other forms of exercise. It helps individuals optimize their workouts and achieve their fitness goals more effectively. Among the different heart rate zones, Zone 2 training has gained significant attention due to its numerous benefits.

In this article, we'll explore the benefits of zone 2 heart rate training, how to determine your zone 2 heart rate, and how to integrate zone 2 training into your exercise program for optimal health benefits.

---

### 1. Improve Cardiovascular Health

Zone 2 heart rate training is a type of aerobic exercise that focuses on training the heart at a moderate intensity. This type of training helps to strengthen the heart and increase its ability to pump blood effectively, which can improve cardiovascular health. [Research](https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/interval-training-for-a-stronger-heart) has shown that zone 2 heart rate training can improve the overall efficiency of the cardiovascular system, leading to a stronger and healthier heart. It can also lower resting heart rate and blood pressure, which can reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.

---

### 2. Increase Endurance and Stamina

Another benefit of zone 2 heart rate training is that it can improve endurance and increase stamina. By training at a moderate intensity, your body becomes more efficient at using oxygen and producing energy, which can help you sustain physical activity for longer periods of time. This type of training is particularly effective for [endurance athletes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6355121/), such as marathon runners and cyclists, who need to maintain a steady pace for extended periods of time.

### 3. Burn More Fat

While high-intensity training is often touted as the best way to burn fat, zone 2 heart rate training can be more effective for weight loss and body composition improvement. By training at a moderate intensity, your body burns a [greater percentage of fat for fuel](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2885974/), rather than relying on carbohydrates. This type of training also helps to boost metabolism, which can lead to increased fat burning in the long term.

---

### 4. Reduce the Risk of Injury

One of the advantages of zone 2 heart rate training is that it allows the body to adapt to exercise gradually, reducing the risk of injury. By training at a moderate intensity, the body can adjust to the demands of exercise without overexerting itself and causing strain on the muscles and joints. This is particularly beneficial for beginners or those returning to exercise after a break, as it helps to prevent injury and allows for a more sustainable exercise program.

---

### 5. Improve Athletic Performance

Zone 2 heart rate training can also improve athletic performance by increasing the body's ability to use oxygen during exercise. This leads to better overall performance, as the body can produce energy more efficiently and sustain physical activity for longer periods of time.

## Strength and Hypertrophy Training

Strength and hypertrophy training are two popular forms of exercise that can help you build muscle, gain strength, and improve overall fitness. While they may seem similar, there are some key differences between these two forms of training, and understanding these differences can help you design a workout plan that meets your specific fitness goals.

In this blog post, we will explore the following:

- The differences between strength and hypertrophy training
- The importance of progressive overload in both types of training
- Ways to measure progress and how to overcome plateaus

We will also discuss the role of nutrition, the benefits of [BCAAs](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/bcaa-7000), pre-workout supplements like [Gold Coast Stim](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/gold-coast-stim-pre-workout/) (formerly Pre-30 V.2) and [Creatine](https://www.vpa.com.au/products/creatine-monohydrate) in muscle recovery and growth. Finally, we will provide tips for incorporating both strength and hypertrophy training into your fitness routine for optimal results.

### Strength vs Hypertrophy Training: What's the Difference?

**Strength training** is focused on building strength and power rather than muscle size. It involves lifting heavy weights and performing compound exercises such as squats, deadlifts, and bench presses. The goal of strength training is to increase your maximum strength in a particular movement pattern. This type of training typically involves lower reps (1-5) and longer rest periods (2-3 minutes) between sets.

**Hypertrophy training**, on the other hand, is focused on building muscle size. It involves lifting moderate to heavy weights for higher reps (8-12) and shorter rest periods (30-60 seconds) between sets. Hypertrophy training typically involves more isolation exercises such as bicep curls, leg extensions, and lateral raises.

Both strength and hypertrophy training can be beneficial for overall fitness and combining them can lead to optimal results.

### The Importance of Progressive Overload

[Progressive overload](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/training/progressive-overload) is the gradual increase in stress placed on the body during exercise. It is the foundation of both strength and hypertrophy training and is necessary for continued progress. Increasing the weight you lift, the number of reps you perform, or the volume of your training each week is an example of progressive overload.

### There’s nothing like going back to our roots and moving like our ancestors in a world where we spend most of our days sitting and slumped behind our desks and hopping into our cars to take us from home to work. In today’s article, we discuss the importance and benefits of incorporating primal functional movements into your fitness routine.

### What are Primal movements?

Primal movements, often referred to in the context of exercise and fitness, are fundamental human movements that are based on natural, functional patterns of motion. These movements are inspired by the way our ancestors moved in their daily activities and are considered essential for building overall strength, mobility, and functional fitness.

Primal movements are often used in functional fitness training to improve physical performance and address imbalances in the body. While there are variations in the classification of primal movements, the following are considered the seven primal functional movements:

#### 1. Squats

Squatting involves bending at the hips and knees while keeping your feet flat on the ground. It's a foundational movement for activities like sitting down, standing up, and lifting objects.

![Squats](https://i.shgcdn.com/b40a6076-463a-4350-8e6a-a9687a6a11bf/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

---

#### 2. Hinge

Hinging movements involve bending at the hips while keeping your spine straight. This movement pattern is essential for activities such as picking up objects from the ground with proper form. Deadlifts and kettlebell swings are hinge exercises.

![Hinge](https://i.shgcdn.com/cc94236a-3607-47a2-9897-09aaae035ed0/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

---

## Having a strong grip is not only essential for athletes but also for everyday tasks and overall hand health. In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the importance of grip strength, various exercises to strengthen your grip, training techniques, and tips for enhancing grip strength.

### Importance of Grip Strength

Strong grip strength has numerous benefits. It improves sports performance, allowing you to excel in activities like rock climbing, tennis, golf, and weightlifting. Additionally, grip strength is vital for everyday tasks such as carrying groceries or opening jars. It also contributes to overall hand health, reducing the risk of common hand and wrist injuries.

Crush grip involves squeezing an object, pinch grip involves pinching between your thumb and fingers, and support grip refers to holding onto an object for an extended period.

## The Crucial Role of Mobility Exercises

In the pursuit of a healthier and more active lifestyle, we often focus on the big players in the fitness game: strength, endurance, and cardiovascular health. However, there's one often-overlooked aspect that plays a crucial role in achieving peak fitness performance - mobility. In this article, we'll delve into the importance of mobility exercises and their profound impact on your overall fitness. Additionally, we'll provide a comprehensive list of 10 mobility exercises tailored to boost your range of motion.

When it comes to fitness, mobility is often the unsung hero. Mobility exercises encompass a variety of movements that enhance the range of motion in your joints and muscles. These exercises may not get as much attention as lifting weights or running marathons, but they are the cornerstone of a well-rounded fitness routine.

Here are some compelling reasons why you should incorporate mobility exercises into your fitness regimen:

- **Injury Prevention:** Improved joint mobility and flexibility can significantly reduce the risk of injuries during physical activities, ensuring you stay active and injury-free.

- **Enhanced Performance:** Better range of motion means your muscles can work more effectively. This translates to improved performance in strength training, cardio workouts, and sports activities.

- **Posture and Alignment:** Mobility exercises contribute to better posture and spinal alignment, reducing the risk of chronic pain and discomfort.

- **Recovery and Rehabilitation:** Mobility exercises are an integral part of recovery from injuries and can accelerate the rehabilitation process.

- **Quality of Life:** Enhanced mobility allows you to perform daily tasks with greater ease and comfort, promoting an active and independent lifestyle, especially as you age.

## What are the best leg workouts for muscle growth?

Some of the best leg workouts for muscle growth include squats, deadlifts, lunges, Bulgarian split squats, and leg presses. These exercises target multiple muscle groups simultaneously, promoting overall leg development. However, let's get into them as enumerated below:

### Squats: The King of Leg Exercises

**Squats** are renowned as the ultimate leg exercise, targeting multiple muscle groups simultaneously. This compound movement engages the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes, making it a highly effective exercise for muscle growth.

To perform squats correctly, start with your feet shoulder-width apart, lower yourself down while keeping your back straight, and push back up to the starting position. Aim for 3 sets of 8-12 reps, gradually increasing the weight as you progress.

![Squats Image](https://i.shgcdn.com/89680258-5736-4258-9b81-54656c11704a/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

### Deadlifts: Engaging Multiple Muscle Groups

**Deadlifts** not only work your legs but also engage your core and back muscles. This powerful compound exercise is ideal for developing overall strength and size in your lower body.

Begin with lighter weights and focus on maintaining proper form. As your strength increases, progress to performing 3 sets of 8 reps with heavier weights.

![Deadlifts Image](https://i.shgcdn.com/126ccba4-7971-437b-8d60-be0468368600/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

### Lunges: Targeting the Quadriceps, Hamstrings, and Glutes

**Lunges** are a fantastic exercise for targeting the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. They also help improve balance and stability.

To perform lunges, step forward with one leg, lower your body until both knees are at a 90-degree angle, and then push back up to the starting position. Alternate between legs and aim for 2-3 sets of 12-15 reps per leg.

### Having a Well-Developed Chest

Having a well-developed chest not only contributes to overall upper body strength but also enhances your aesthetic appearance. A strong and sculpted chest is a goal for many fitness enthusiasts, and achieving it requires a combination of targeted exercises, proper form, adequate nutrition, and smart workout strategies.

In this comprehensive guide, we will dive into the world of chest workouts, addressing different exercises, training techniques, and essential tips for maximizing your chest gains.

So, let's get started!

### Importance of a Well-Developed Chest

A well-developed chest is more than just a showpiece. It is a vital component of overall upper body strength. The chest muscles, also known as the pectoralis major and pectoralis minor, play a crucial role in various movements like pushing, pulling, and stabilizing the shoulders. Additionally, a well-developed chest enhances posture and symmetry, making your physique appear more balanced and proportionate.

### Targeting Specific Areas of the Chest

The chest can be divided into three main areas: upper chest, middle chest, and lower chest. To achieve a fully developed chest, it is important to target each of these areas.

---

#### Upper Chest Exercises

Targeting the upper chest, known anatomically as the clavicular head of the pectoralis major, can help create a more balanced and full chest appearance. Incorporating a variety of angles and movements will ensure comprehensive development.

Here are some effective chest exercises that emphasize the upper chest:

1. **Incline Barbell Bench Press**
   - Lie on an incline bench set at an angle between 30 to 45 degrees.
   - Hold the barbell with a grip slightly wider than shoulder-width.
   - Lower the bar to your upper chest, then press it back up.
   - This is a foundational compound movement for the upper chest.

### Shoulder Workouts Guide

Shoulder workouts are often overlooked in favor of exercises that target larger muscle groups like the chest or back. However, neglecting your shoulder muscles can lead to imbalances, poor posture, and an increased risk of injury.

### Importance of Shoulder Workouts

Shoulder workouts are vital for overall upper-body strength and stability. When you engage in exercises that target your shoulder muscles, you not only enhance your shoulder strength but also improve your posture and prevent injuries. Strong shoulders provide a stable base for other upper-body exercises and overall functional movements.

### Some of the Best Shoulder Workouts for More Muscle

Developing strong, sculpted shoulders requires targeting the three primary deltoid heads: the anterior (front), medial (lateral or side), and posterior (rear) deltoids. Here are some of the best shoulder exercises to add muscle mass to this crucial area:

#### Overhead Shoulder Press (Military Press)

- It can be performed with dumbbells, a barbell, or on a machine.
- Primarily targets the anterior and medial deltoids.

#### Dumbbell Side Lateral Raises

- Isolates the medial deltoid.
- Ensure you're lifting with your shoulders, not your hands, to maximize muscle engagement.

## Understanding Health Metrics: Discover What They Are and Why They Matter

In the realm of health and wellness, it's crucial to understand that there's more to maintaining good health and fitness than just a steady number on the weighing scale. A broader spectrum of health metrics plays a significant role in determining our overall well-being.

This article discusses the often-overlooked health indicators that can provide a well-rounded perspective on our health and well-being.

The world of health metrics may feel overwhelming to navigate, but we've streamlined it into notable key areas that every individual should be monitoring for a holistic health overview.

Health metrics provide tangible, quantifiable data about an individual's health status. From the heart rate to sleep quality, these metrics shed light on various aspects of our health and give us the information needed to make necessary lifestyle changes.

### Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

HRV measures the variation in time between each heartbeat. Monitoring HRV can help indicate your body's response to stress and fatigue, which brings us to the question –

#### How can Heart Rate Variability (HRV) impact my health?

- HRV reflects the balance between your sympathetic nervous system (fight-or-flight response) and your parasympathetic nervous system (rest and digest response). A higher HRV is generally associated with a healthier autonomic nervous system, indicating better adaptability to stressors.

- **Stress Management:** HRV can also be an indicator of your ability to manage stress. Lower HRV may suggest a higher level of chronic stress, while higher HRV is associated with better stress resilience. Stress management is crucial for overall health because chronic stress can contribute to various health problems.

- **Cardiovascular Health:** Reduced HRV has been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, including heart attacks and arrhythmias. It can also be a marker for hypertension and other cardiovascular issues. High HRV indicates better cardiovascular fitness and resilience to stress.

- **Physical Fitness:** Regular physical activity and aerobic exercise can increase HRV, which is a sign of improved cardiovascular fitness. Athletes often have a higher HRV due to their well-conditioned cardiovascular systems.

## Content

If you are looking to start your fitness journey or seeking a refreshing change in your current workout routine, welcome aboard! Chances are, you are thinking of exploring pilates but what is it and what are its origins?

Pilates is a series of exercises designed to improve physical strength, flexibility, and posture, while also enhancing mental awareness. Originated in the early 20th century by a German physical trainer named Joseph Pilates, this regimen was formulated for injured athletes and dancers for a fast and effective recovery. Pilates exercises can be done on a mat or on special equipment, such as a reformer, which provides resistance and support.

## Who is pilates good for?

Pilates is a versatile form of exercise that can be beneficial for a wide range of individuals as well as different fitness levels as it can be customised to fit individual goals and needs. Pilates can cater to a variety of people from complete beginners to athletes, seniors, post-rehabilitation patients, and even pregnant women with a special prenatal pilates program.

## Six Principles of Pilates

- **Breath** – Proper breathing is fundamental to pilates. You should inhale deeply through your nose, expanding your ribcage, and exhale fully through your mouth, engaging your abdominal muscles. The breath helps you maintain control, focus, and stability during exercises.
- **Concentration** – the mind-body connection is crucial in pilates. Focus on the quality of your movements, paying attention to alignment, form, and muscle engagement. Avoid distractions and practice with intention.
- **Control** – Pilates encourages precise and controlled movements. Avoid using momentum or jerky motions. Instead, move with deliberation and control to engage and strengthen specific muscles.
- **Centering** – Pilates emphasises the concept of a “powerhouse,” which includes your abdominal muscles, lower back, pelvic floor, and buttocks. All movements start from this center, which provides stability and supports your spine.
- **Precision** – Each exercise in Pilates has a specific form and alignment. Pay close attention to the details of each movement, as precision is more important than quantity. Proper form reduces the risk of injury and maximizes the benefits.
- **Flow** – Pilates exercises are often performed in a flowing and continuous manner. Transitions between movements should be smooth and controlled, promoting grace and efficiency in your practice.

For beginners wondering about the essential tips for pilates, an understanding of its foundational principles is paramount. These principles work synergistically to create a harmonious balance between your mind and body, making pilates a holistic form of exercise.

## Getting Familiar with Pilates Equipment: From Reformers to Mat Work

If you’re just starting out with Pilates, all you really need is your body, a mat, and a towel. However, if you plan to join Pilates classes in a studio should be introduced to the Pilates Reformer, a versatile machine that provides resistance for a variety of exercises. Selecting between mat work and equipment is a personal choice and depends on your fitness goals.

## Beginner-friendly Pilates Exercises

If you're new to Pilates, it's essential to start with beginner-friendly exercises that help you build a strong foundation and proper technique. Here are five beginner-friendly Pilates exercises to get you started:

### The Hundred:

- Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart.
- Engage your core muscles and lift your head, neck, and shoulders off the mat.
- Extend your arms straight by your sides, a few inches off the mat, and pump them up and down as you inhale for five counts and exhale for five counts.
- Repeat this cycle for a total of 10 breath cycles, aiming to keep your core engaged throughout.

If you dare to be great at anything in this world, and so much so with your fitness, we’ll let you in on a secret. And although we’ve got just the right supplements to help you get there, it's not some supplement or the latest workout craze endorsed by your favourite influencer. It's something far more primal, far more potent. It's the unyielding dance between routine and discipline.

### ROUTINE

Routine is your North Star in a sea of chaos. It's the anchor that keeps you grounded and provides a sense of stability and control when life tries to knock you off your game. It's about setting a schedule and sticking to it, no matter what. Whether it's hitting the gym at the crack of dawn or meal prepping like your life depends on it, routine breeds consistency – and consistency is the currency of champions.

### DISCIPLINE

Discipline on the other hand, is the backbone that keeps you accountable when temptations strike. It's the voice in your head that says, "Get up and get moving" when all you want to do is hit snooze. Discipline is what separates the weekend warriors from the true fitness champions. Because in the gritty world of fitness, there are no shortcuts, no easy roads to greatness. There's just you, your sweat-soaked resolve, and the relentless grind of routine and discipline.

Whether you're aiming to shed a few pounds, build muscle, or improve your cardiovascular endurance, consistency is key. It's the cumulative effect of small, positive actions repeated day in and day out that leads to real, tangible results.

Other than the physical gains (although that’s a damn fine perk) – routine and discipline also forge the right mindset and habits. A mindset that refuses to settle for mediocrity and thrives on the grind. By consistently showing up and putting in the work, you're rewiring your brain. Healthy habits become second nature, and eventually promotes long-term sustainability. Fad diets and sporadic workout routines are often not sustainable in the long run. By adopting a balanced and consistent approach, you're more likely to maintain your health and fitness habits over time.

So, the next time you find yourself hitting a plateau or struggling to stay motivated, remember this: you've got the power within you to rise above. You've got the fire in your belly, the steel in your spine, the relentless hunger for more.

So, lace up those kicks, chalk up those hands, and step into the arena like the warrior you were born to be. Keep going, embrace the struggle, and watch as routine and discipline transform you from mere mortal to absolute legends!

The world of fitness can be overwhelming. With countless workout styles and conflicting advice, it's easy to feel lost. But here's a secret weapon for anyone seeking optimal fitness: combining cardio and strength training.

Think of it like this: cardio is the engine that keeps you going, while strength training builds a stronger, more efficient chassis. In this article, we go over why these different exercises complement each other beautifully, and the amazing benefits they bring when done together.

## The Power of Two: Complementary Benefits

While sculpted muscles and impressive strength are the hallmarks of a bodybuilder's physique, neglecting cardio in favor of pure weight training can be a missed opportunity. Here's why incorporating cardio into a bodybuilding or athletic routine offers a surprising range of benefits that directly translate to enhanced performance and improved aesthetics.

Cardio, also known as aerobic exercise, gets your heart pumping. Activities like running, swimming, or brisk walking improve your cardiovascular health, lung capacity, and endurance. Strength training, on the other hand, focuses on building muscle mass and strength. Think lifting weights, bodyweight exercises like squats and lunges, or resistance bands.

These seemingly different exercises complement each other beautifully. Here's how:

- **Fat-Burning Furnace:** Cardio burns calories during the workout. Strength training builds muscle, which acts like a metabolic engine, burning more calories even at rest. Consistent cardio burns calories and helps reduce overall body fat percentage. This double whammy helps with weight loss and management and gives athletes and bodybuilders a well-balanced shredded and defined look.

- **Endurance Engine:** Bodybuilding and athletic endeavors often involve sustained exertion, pushing your body to its limits for extended periods. Cardio training, like running, swimming, or HIIT workouts, strengthens your cardiovascular system by increasing lung capacity and improving blood flow. This translates to better oxygen delivery to your muscles, allowing you to train harder for longer durations with less fatigue. Imagine powering through those final sets of squats or pushing through that last lap on the track with greater stamina – that's the power of a cardio-enhanced engine.

- **Faster Recovery:** Intense weight training creates microscopic tears in muscle fibers, which is how muscle growth occurs during the recovery phase. Regular cardio improves blood circulation, which delivers essential nutrients and oxygen to your muscles at a faster rate. This expedited delivery system speeds up muscle repair and recovery, allowing you to get back to the gym feeling stronger and ready to conquer your next workout.

- **Heart Health Hero:** Both cardio and strength training can lower your blood pressure, reduce the risk of heart disease, and improve cholesterol levels. They work together to keep your heart healthy and strong.

### The pull-up: A Fundamental Exercise in Fitness

This article serves as a guide to mastering the pull-up exercise. We will delve into the basics, advantages, and provide you with the necessary knowledge and techniques to achieve a successful pull-up.

---

#### The Powerhouse: Muscles Engaged in a Pull-Up

At its core, a pull-up is an upper-body exercise that utilizes your body weight as resistance. It is a compound exercise, targeting multiple muscle groups simultaneously. The key muscles involved include:

- **Latissimus dorsi (Lats):** These large back muscles are the primary movers responsible for pulling your body up.
- **Biceps brachii (Biceps):** Your biceps support the lats by flexing your elbows to bring you closer to the bar.
- **Brachialis:** Situated beneath the biceps, this muscle aids in elbow flexion during the pull.

---

#### Additional Muscles Engaged

- **Teres major:** Located on the side of your upper back, it works in conjunction with the lats for pulling and shoulder rotation.
- **Forearms:** Grip strength is crucial here, with the forearms stabilizing your hold on the bar.
- **Core:** A strong core is essential for stability and to prevent excessive swinging during the pull-up.

But staying active during the colder months is crucial for maintaining both physical and mental well-being. Here's how to create a winter wellness routine that keeps you energised, healthy, and ready to greet spring with a smile.

---

### Sleep: The Foundation of Winter Wellness

A good night's sleep is the cornerstone of good health, and winter presents unique challenges. Shorter days disrupt our circadian rhythm, the body's natural sleep-wake cycle, making it harder to fall asleep and wake up feeling refreshed. Here are some tips to ensure you're getting the recommended 7-8 hours of sleep each night:

- **Maintain a consistent [sleep schedule](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/sleep-hygiene):** Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day, even on weekends. This helps regulate your body's internal clock
- **Embrace the light:** Maximise exposure to bright light during the day, [especially in the morning.](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/power-of-the-morning-sunlight) Open curtains as soon as you wake up or consider using a light therapy lamp.
- **Wind down before bed:** Create a relaxing bedtime routine that signals to your body it's time to wind down. Take a warm bath, read a book, or practice calming stretches.
- **Optimise your sleep environment:** Make sure your bedroom is cool, dark, and quiet. Invest in blackout curtains and earplugs if necessary.
- **Limit screen time before bed:** The blue light emitted from electronic devices can suppress melatonin production, a hormone that regulates sleep. Avoid screens for at least an hour before bedtime.

---

### Exercise: Keeping Your Body Moving All Winter Long

Although Australia's winter may be milder than some, it can still be a deterrent to outdoor exercise. The benefits of regular exercise are well-documented, and they're especially important during winter. Exercise boosts the immune system, making it hard for you to catch the flu or colds. It also improves mood and helps regulate sleep. But how do you stay motivated when the outdoors is frosty, and the gym seems less appealing?

---

#### Outdoor Activities:

- **Embrace the Sunshine:** Australia is known for its sunshine, so take advantage of it! Go for a brisk walk, jog, or bike ride during the warmest part of the day.
- **Hit the Beach:** While swimming might not be for everyone in winter, beach walks are a fantastic way to get some exercise and enjoy the fresh air. The soft sand adds an element of challenge to your walk, strengthening your leg muscles.
- **Park Workouts:** Local parks offer a variety of possibilities. Find a park with exercise equipment and do a bodyweight circuit, play a game of frisbee with friends, or join your local bootcamp classes outdoors, or a cool new run club!
- **Surfing:** Winter is prime surfing season in many parts of Australia. Whether you're a seasoned surfer or a curious beginner, hitting the waves is a fantastic way to get exercise and enjoy the beauty of the ocean. Just remember to dress appropriately and prioritise safety.

---

#### Hiking Adventures:

Many national parks and trails remain open throughout winter. Hiking or bushwalking is a great way to explore the outdoors, get some fresh air, and enjoy the scenery. Choose trails appropriate for the weather conditions and dress in layers for changing temperatures.

---

#### Indoor Activities:

- **Hit the Gym:** Gyms offer a climate-controlled environment where you can continue your fitness routine regardless of the weather outside. Try out different classes or work with a personal trainer to keep things interesting.
- **Home Workouts:** If going to the gym isn't your thing, there are plenty of effective home workout options available. From bodyweight exercises to online workout videos, you can stay active without leaving the comfort of your home.

---

By incorporating a mix of outdoor and indoor activities, you can stay active and healthy throughout the winter months. Remember to listen to your body and adjust your routine as needed to stay motivated and engaged.

# Boost Your Lactate Threshold and Enhance Running Performance

Learn science-backed strategies to boost your lactate threshold, enhance running performance, and achieve your fitness goals. Discover expert tips and techniques here.

---

## Content

Have you ever hit that dreaded "wall" during a run? That point where your legs feel like lead, your breathing becomes ragged, and maintaining pace feels like an impossible feat? This, my fellow runner, is likely your lactate threshold rearing its ugly head. But by understanding the intricacies of your body’s performance and improving your lactate threshold is key to maximising your potential.

## Lactate Threshold: The Science Behind the Burn

During exercise, your body breaks down glucose for energy. This process produces lactate, a byproduct that your muscles can use as fuel. However, as intensity increases, lactate production outpaces your body's ability to clear it. This buildup disrupts muscle function, leading to fatigue and that dreaded wall. Your lactate threshold (LT) is the intensity at which this tipping point occurs.

Think of LT as a dam holding back fatigue. By raising the dam wall (increasing LT), you can run faster and further before the lactate buildup overwhelms your system, making this performance indicator an essential for endurance athletes. Studies have shown that a higher LT directly translates to improved running performance at various distances.

## Benefits of a Higher Lactate Threshold

Here are some ways a higher LT can transform your running:

- **Improved Endurance:** A higher LT allows you to maintain a faster pace for longer distances. This translates to quicker race times and the ability to push through those previously grueling long runs with greater ease.
- **Delayed Fatigue Onset:** With a higher LT, lactate buildup takes longer to hit critical levels. This means you can run harder for extended periods before experiencing fatigue, allowing you to dig deeper during workouts and races.
- **Faster Recovery:** Studies also suggest that improved lactate threshold training can enhance your body's ability to clear lactate after exercise. This translates to quicker recovery times between workouts, allowing you to train more consistently.

## Building a Stronger Dam: Strategies to Increase Your Lactate Threshold

Now that you understand the importance of LT, let's explore how to raise that metaphorical dam wall and become a more resilient runner. Here are some key strategies:

- **Build Your Aerobic Base:** A strong aerobic foundation is crucial for lactate threshold training. Aim for consistent long-duration, low-intensity runs or ‘easy runs,’ gradually increasing your weekly mileage. This strengthens your cardiovascular system, helps build endurance and teaches your body to utilise fat as fuel, sparing glycogen, and delaying lactate production. A great example of this is incorporating [zone 2 training](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/training/10-benefits-of-zone-2-heart-rate-training-optimising-your-workouts) in your routine.
- **Embrace Tempo Runs:** Tempo runs are sustained efforts at a comfortably hard pace, typically just below your lactate threshold. These runs train your body to work harder at a more manageable lactate level, gradually pushing your LT upwards. Aim for tempo runs lasting 20-40 minutes, 2-3 times per week.
- **Interval Training:** Interval training involves alternating periods of high-intensity effort with recovery periods. This pushes your body beyond LT, forcing it to adapt and clear lactate more effectively. Popular formats include fartlek training (speed bursts during easy runs) and track intervals (repeating short, fast efforts with recovery jogs). Start with shorter intervals and gradually increase intensity and duration as you adapt.
- **Strength Training:** Don't neglect the weight room! Strength training builds stronger muscles, which are more efficient at using oxygen and clearing lactate. Focus on exercises that target major muscle groups used in running, like squats, lunges, and core work.

**Remember:**

Consistency is key! Lactate threshold training takes time and dedication. Be patient, listen to your body, and gradually increase intensity and volume over time. Don't forget to incorporate rest days for proper recovery.
