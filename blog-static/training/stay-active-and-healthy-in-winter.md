## Sleep: The Foundation of Winter Wellness

A good night's sleep is the cornerstone of good health, and winter presents unique challenges. Shorter days disrupt our circadian rhythm, the body's natural sleep-wake cycle, making it harder to fall asleep and wake up feeling refreshed. Here are some tips to ensure you're getting the recommended 7-8 hours of sleep each night:

- **Maintain a consistent [sleep schedule](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/sleep-hygiene):** Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day, even on weekends. This helps regulate your body's internal clock
- **Embrace the light:** Maximise exposure to bright light during the day, [especially in the morning.](https://www.vpa.com.au/blogs/featured-articles/power-of-the-morning-sunlight) Open curtains as soon as you wake up or consider using a light therapy lamp.
- **Wind down before bed:** Create a relaxing bedtime routine that signals to your body it's time to wind down. Take a warm bath, read a book, or practice calming stretches.
- **Optimise your sleep environment:** Make sure your bedroom is cool, dark, and quiet. Invest in blackout curtains and earplugs if necessary.
- **Limit screen time before bed:** The blue light emitted from electronic devices can suppress melatonin production, a hormone that regulates sleep. Avoid screens for at least an hour before bedtime.

## Exercise: Keeping Your Body Moving All Winter Long

Although Australia's winter may be milder than some, it can still be a deterrent to outdoor exercise. The benefits of regular exercise are well-documented, and they're especially important during winter. Exercise boosts the immune system, making it hard for you to catch the flu or colds. It also improves mood and helps regulate sleep. But how do you stay motivated when the outdoors is frosty, and the gym seems less appealing?

### Outdoor Activities:

- **Embrace the Sunshine:** Australia is known for its sunshine, so take advantage of it! Go for a brisk walk, jog, or bike ride during the warmest part of the day.
- **Hit the Beach:** While swimming might not be for everyone in winter, beach walks are a fantastic way to get some exercise and enjoy the fresh air. The soft sand adds an element of challenge to your walk, strengthening your leg muscles.
- **Park Workouts:** Local parks offer a variety of possibilities. Find a park with exercise equipment and do a bodyweight circuit, play a game of frisbee with friends, or join your local bootcamp classes outdoors, or a cool new run club!
- **Surfing:** Winter is prime surfing season in many parts of Australia. Whether you're a seasoned surfer or a curious beginner, hitting the waves is a fantastic way to get exercise and enjoy the beauty of the ocean. Just remember to dress appropriately and prioritise safety.

### Hiking Adventures:

Many national parks and trails remain open throughout winter. Hiking or bushwalking is a great way to explore the outdoors, get some fresh air, and enjoy the scenery. Choose trails appropriate for the weather conditions and dress in layers for changing temperatures.

### Indoor Activities:

- **Hit the Gym:** Gyms offer a climate-controlled environment...
