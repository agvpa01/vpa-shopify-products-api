### Bring your own toilet paper

- We all know that gyms are going to run out of dunny roll this flu season, so unless you want to get poop on your gym towel, then itâ€™s essential to bring your own toilet paper.

### Wear a face mask

- If you canâ€™t get your hands on a face mask, buy an altitude training mask. Not only will you sound and look like Darth Vader but youâ€™ll also be protected from smelling the farts of your mates.

### Avoid making out with other gym goers

- This sounds tempting but is a definitely no-go during flu season especially with the coronavirus. The pash and dash is definitely only recommended during Summer months.

### Donâ€™t drink Corona during your gym session

- This has nothing to do with Coronavirus, but it will make your gym sessions a bit fuzzy. You may seem funnier and have increased dancing ability but itâ€™s probably not worth the injury risk. Try our [BCAA 7000](/products/bcaa-7000) instead as a delicious intra-workout drink. ðŸ˜‰
