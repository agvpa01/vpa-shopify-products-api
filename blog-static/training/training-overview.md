**Excerpt:** # Understanding DOMS (Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness)

DOMS, short for Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness, is a common condition that many people experience after intense physical activity. It typically occurs 24 to 48 hours after exercise and can cause discomfort and reduced range of motion in the affected muscles.

## How to Relieve Sore Muscles

If you are experiencing DOMS, there are several ways to help relieve the soreness and discomfort:

- **Rest:** Allow your muscles to recover by taking a break from intense exercise.
- **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water to help flush out toxins and reduce muscle stiffness.
- **Gentle Stretching:** Perform gentle stretches to improve flexibility and reduce muscle tension.
- **Foam Rolling:** Use a foam roller to massage and release tension in sore muscles.
- **Warm Bath:** Soaking in a warm bath can help relax tight muscles and improve circulation.

## Tips and Treatments

- **Proper Nutrition:** Ensure you are consuming enough protein and nutrients to support muscle recovery.
- **Massage Therapy:** Consider getting a professional massage to help alleviate muscle soreness.
- **Over-the-Counter Pain Relief:** Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can help reduce pain and inflammation.
- **Gradual Progression:** Gradually increase the intensity of your workouts to prevent severe DOMS.

By following these tips and treatments, you can help reduce the severity of DOMS and promote faster muscle recovery. Remember to listen to your body and give it the care it needs after intense physical activity.
