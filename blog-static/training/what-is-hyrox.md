## Calling all gym rats, runners, and fitness fanatics! If you're looking for a new challenge that pushes your physical and mental limits, look no further than Hyrox Fitness. Often dubbed the "World Series of Fitness Racing," **Hyrox** is a unique hybrid competition that's rapidly gaining popularity worldwide.

This article dives deep into everything you need to know about Hyrox Fitness, from the format and benefits to training tips and how to get involved in your first race.

## What is Hyrox?

[Hyrox](https://hyrox.com/the-fitness-race/), derived from "Hypertrophy" and "Oxygen," is a fitness competition born in Germany. Unlike standard gym routines or basic fitness regimes, Hyrox challenges both your functional strength and endurance running. Participants complete a grueling yet exhilarating eight-part circuit, consisting of a 1-kilometer run followed by a functional workout station. This format repeats eight times, testing both your cardiovascular fitness and muscular strength.

This structured format of Hyrox competitions makes it unique and adds an element of surprise that keeps participants on their toes.
