### With gyms all over Australia closed for several weeks now, I have no doubt there are a lot of you thinking that all of your hard work will go to waste. This is made harder since we have no idea when we can open again. It could be 2 months or 3 months or 6 months…who knows! If there is one thing Jacks and I know with absolute certainty though, it is this… NONE of your hard work is wasted and you won't lose your gains. How do we know this? First-hand experience!

"Out of adversity comes opportunity" – Benjamin Franklin

Both Jacks and I have had lengthy absences from training. I’ve had to come back from 2 major injuries, and over the years Jacks has had to prioritize her day job, running Iron Strength, and organizing competitions, with her most recent hiatus from training lasting 16 weeks. Yep, 4 months! Yet, she can still bust out a 180kg deadlift most days of the week once she’s back to training consistently. And that’s solely because of the hard work she has put in over the years. So all is not lost guys.

For those of you without access to a proper weights setup, this may be the longest forced layoff from strength training you will ever have to face. Yes, it feels like the end of the world and yes, it is not ideal. BUT, it is entirely manageable AND you could come out the other side in better shape than ever! This is the perfect OPPORTUNITY for us all to work on a number of areas we may not have prioritized in the past…myself included!

### Here are 3 things you can and should be doing while self-isolating:

---

#### 1. Sort your diet out…for real this time!

---

#### 2. Actually do all that mobility & stability work you should have been doing in the first place.

---

#### 3. Continue to train with whatever you have available…even if they are objects from the pantry or the garden shed.

---

### You won’t lose your gains!

The bottom line here: sitting around feeling sorry for yourself and eating everything in sight is absolutely pointless. If you want to keep those gains, it’s all there. Stop scrolling aimlessly through Covid-19 posts, and get to work! Let’s all come out the other side of this stronger, healthier and ready to shift some real IRON.

PS…sorry about the lame motivational quote, but it’s kinda fitting right now, don’t you think!?
