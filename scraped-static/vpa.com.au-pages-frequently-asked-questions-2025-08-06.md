# FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

## PAYMENT

**What forms of payment do you accept?**

VPA accepts a number of different payments methods.
Please visit our Payments Options page for a full listing of payment options including credit cards, cheque, money orders and direct deposit.
All orders must be processed through the website. We do not accept orders by fax or email.

**Does VPA save my Credit Card details?**

VPA does NOT store any credit card details nor does ANY other party. We use Commonwealth Bank's latest "token technology" meaning you only need to enter your credit card details ONCE on our site. For future transactions our bank will charge your credit card based on your account with us.

Sorry to hear about this. Please email us via sales@vpa.com.au the following information ASAP.

- Name of Customer on Order:

We will have the duplicate transaction refunded to you immediately. It will take 2-3 working days to appear on your online credit card statement.

## SHOPPING

**How do I shop at VPA?**

Please visit our section "How to Shop at VPA" for a detailed explanation of how to shop on our site.

**An item that I was about to purchase is listed as out-of-stock. What can I do?**

Unfortunately there is very little that we can do in the short term. The Checkout Counter will not let you proceed until you have removed the item from your Shopping Cart.
VPA uses a sophisticated shopping cart facility to ensure that products cannot be purchased that are out of stock. This is to protect you, the consumer, from lengthy product lead times. However, if you Contact Us with the details of the item which you wish to purchase, we will notify you of it's availability as soon as it is received.

**How do I change my address?**

You can change your address by going to the Account Details section and following the option to "View or change entries in my address book.".
Remember, you are not able to change the address of a delivery once the payment has been completed and 10 minutes has passed.

**Has my order been received?**

Once you place an order, a confirmation email is sent immediately to your inbox. If you have not received this email within 2 hours, please login to your account and confirm that your email address is listed correctly. If your email address has been listed correctly, please contact us with your order details as soon as possible and we will see to the matter. If your email address has not been listed correctly all that is required is for you to correct the address. Your order will still be mailed to the correct address.

**How do I get my Password back?**

It happens to us all from time to time! Don't worry. If you have forgotten your password, simply click on Forgotten Password on the login page and we will email you to create a new one.
Once logged into your account, you will be able to change your password to whatever you find easy to remember.

**Can I cancel something after I have ordered?**

Unfortunately, we are unable to reverse transactions through our payment gateway once a transaction has been put through. A cancellation fee of AUD$20 (regardless of payment method) will be deducted from your payment as well as a deduction for postage costs (to and from). The balance of your payment will be refunded by Cheque.

## SECURITY

**Is ordering on your site secure?**

VPA utilises the highest security platforms available to ensure that all personal details and transactions are processed securely. You will NOT have to leave this site throughout the entire checkout process. VPA does not have access to your credit card information and we are only informed whether the transaction has been authorised by St George bank. This enables us to offer customers a safe and speedy shopping experience.

**What security measures do you use?**

- **Use of FREE web based email**
  We allow our customers to supply us with a free web based email address however it will be treated with caution. Close to 100% of all credit card fraud is committed using fake e-mails provided by free web based e-mail services such as Hotmail.
- **Large orders**
  Large orders may be verified with the customer over the phone before the products are dispatched.
- **Capturing of information**
  We capture information such as your IP address so that it is possible to trace you back to your location at the time the transaction took place.
  These are just some of the steps we are taking to make your shopping environment a safe and secure one. We hope you enjoy shopping with us.
