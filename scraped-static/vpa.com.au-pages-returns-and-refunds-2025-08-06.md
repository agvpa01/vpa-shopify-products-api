If you've already opened a product and feel there is a problem with product quality, then we'd like to hear about it. Please get in touch and specify 'Product Quality' in the form below. Let us know the batch code of the product (it will be printed on the same sticker the best before date is) as this is essential to us opening an investigation.

It is also essential for us to open an investigation that you do not dispose of the product, as we may require further details or its return.

Quality is extremely important to us, so before we do anything we open an investigation into the specific product and batch you received. If we can identify a problem with the batch, we'll be more than happy to provide a replacement product from a corrected batch or full refund. We'll also cover all shipping costs.

1. Do not throw out the product.
2. Please complete this form: [https://vpa.fit/returns-form](https://vpa.fit/returns-form)
3. We'll email you within 1-2 business days of receiving your form submission.
