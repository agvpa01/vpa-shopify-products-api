# Refund policy

We strongly believe in our products and want every customer to leave satisfied, whether they like our products or not. For this reason, we created the VPA Product Guarantee. Due to unavoidable fraudulent activity, we have had to create guidelines for returns and replacements.

- The VPA product was purchased directly through the VPA website
- The VPA product was purchased within the last 30 days.
- Approximately 90% of the product is returned to VPA. There are two reasons we have had to request this. Firstly, to stop those customers who want to take advantage of the Product Guarantee to get free products. Secondly, to test the product upon return.
  NOTE: There are no exchanges or refunds on free promotional products
