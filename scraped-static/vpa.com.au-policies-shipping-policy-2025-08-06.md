# WHAT COURIERS DO YOU USE TO SHIP WITHIN AUSTRALIA?

# WHAT IS A WORKING DAY?

In Australia, a working day is considered 9AM-5.30PM Monday to Friday (excluding public holidays); however, couriers start delivering from 7AM. For example, if you order at 9PM on a Friday night, you'll receive your order on Wednesday if you are in Syd/Bris/Melb (because Sat, Sun & public holidays are not working days).

## DELIVERY TIME

Whilst we do everything in our capacity (including having staff work throughout the night during sales periods) we are unable to guarantee delivery times and do not accept liability suffered for delays in deliveries.

**Please note:** Australia Post orders may take longer than courier delivery and are subject to usual Australia Post Shipping times over which we have no control.

# WHAT CAN YOU DO TO MINIMISE DELAYS

- DO deliver to a work address - Why?, they are easy to locate and are generally open between 9-5.30 (Monday to Friday)
- DO include the name of your business/workplace in the first address line (to help couriers locate the business)
- DO be polite when dealing with your local courier
- DO order when your supplement supply has 5 days remaining to allow for possible delays in delivery
- DO order on Monday or Tuesday (98% delivery success rate before the end of the week)

## DELIVERY TO UNITS/TOWN-HOUSES

By far our largest category of "missed first-time deliveries" is to units and town-houses. Whilst small packages can be left in a letter box, our package sizes are too large to leave in a letterbox. Unless there is a manned receptionist in the lobby that can accept the package, our couriers will not be able to use elevators or walk down corridors to locate a door to your unit/townhouse. We always suggest choosing Australia Post as your courier for delivery to townhouses and units.

# AUTHORITY TO LEAVE

Please note that by selecting "Authority to Leave", this does not constitute a guarantee that items will be left at your premises unattended. The discretion of the courier in question is used in determining whether it is safe and viable for items to be left. In general our packages are large and can be easily seen by passing traffic; hence, the need for some discretion to be applied. By purchasing at VPA, you are agreeing to these terms without question. The discretion of couriers may be used to leave parcels unattended if it is safe and practicable to do so.

# REQUESTS OF COURIERS

You will note that our website does not allow for requests of couriers. In discussions with our freight forwarders, we have been advised that they would no longer be accepting "Customer Requests" from both a liability and efficiency perspective (effective as of 01/07/2014).

Couriers were receiving unreasonable requests, examples of which are given below:

- "Key is under the mat, can you please leave package inside front door" (What if something goes missing from the house?)
- "Can you please phone before delivery so that I can arrange for neighbour to meet you at front door" (Courier costs would increase dramatically if they were required to phone prior to each delivery).
- "Can you please leave at a reasonable height so that dog can't reach it" (How high can your dog jump?)

# PLACING AND ACCEPTING ORDERS

Orders will not be dispatched until payment in full has been received and VPA is satisfied with the integrity of the order. VPA is not responsible for any loss or damage caused by late delivery or cancellation of an order or a product. Placement of an order by you constitutes an offer to enter into an agreement with us ("your offer"). We will email you an Order Confirmation for the sole purpose of confirming the details of your offer. Please note that our Order Confirmation does not constitute an acceptance of your offer or reflect the status of your order in any way. VPA reserves the right to dispatch items from ANY warehouse around the country depending on stock levels.

# CANCELLATION BY VPA

We reserve the right not to provide goods or services, terminate membership accounts, remove or edit content or cancel orders (or part thereof) at our sole discretion at any time. Without limiting the operation of any other Terms and Conditions herein, we will not be held liable for loss or damage arising from the exercising of these rights.

# CANCELLATION BY THE CUSTOMER

Our agreement with you only comes into existence once we have both confirmed your order and your payment has been processed. Once we have accepted payment for an order, cancellation of the order is within our sole discretion. Orders that cannot be cancelled will be subject to our terms, conditions and policies relating to Returns and Exchanges. Orders cannot be cancelled once product has been shipped. All cancellations will have a $10 shipping charge per 4kg(inbuilt into the product price) that will not be refunded; should the company choose to accept the cancellation after dispatch (this includes cases where an incorrect/incomplete address is provided by the customer). In the event that a customer is unable to provide an alternative address for a re-delivery (where the initial delivery is returned as undeliverable), a $10 shipping charge per 4kg will be withheld from the refund processed.

# DELIVERY

It is your obligation to enter the correct delivery address details at the time of ordering. Should you enter the wrong address, we are not obliged to re-send the order to the correct address at our expense. Please note that if an item has been lost in transit, we will not despatch a replacement item immediately. Replacement items will be despatched according to our discretion. In the case that our couriers are not able to make contact with you despite repeated efforts, the cost of the product less any shipping charges built into the price of the product will be included in any refunds. Domestic delivery is handled by various couriers and is subject to their terms and conditions. Without limiting the operation of any other Terms and Conditions herein, we will not accept liability for any loss or damage arising from a late delivery. You agree that late delivery does not constitute a failure of our agreement, and does not entitle you to cancellation of an order. We will not accept liability for any loss or damage arising from items lost, stolen or damaged after delivery has taken place.

# NON RECEIPT OF PACKAGE

In the circumstance where a package is not received by a customer, despite the online tracking stating the contrary (signed or unsigned), a statutory declaration will be required by the recipient in order for an investigation/claim to begin. Whilst we would rather not have to do this, this is our policy to avoid users abusing the system (i.e. Demanding free product for "non-receipted" deliveries.) At the end of the day it will be you, the honest customer, that is paying for this.

# GOODS DAMAGED, FAULTY OR INCORRECT ON DELIVERY

VPA's main priority is your satisfaction. If you receive products that are damaged or faulty, we will happily organize an exchange for you. You must return damaged/faulty/incorrect goods within 7 days of receipt. If a product is later deemed to be faulty, normal warranty conditions for that product apply. In the event that you receive a defective or damaged product, we will despatch you a replacement item (subject to availability) once we receive the return, at our cost (at least ninety percent of the product must be returned in order to qualify for an exchange or refund). Please note that all products that are found to be non-defective will incur the delivery costs of returning the item to VPA
