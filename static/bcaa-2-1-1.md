## Description

What is BCAA 2:1:1? Branched Chain Amino Acids or BCAA’s are a group of three essential amino acids (can’t be made in the body and must come from food sources) that optimize your body for rapid muscle recovery. The three amino acids that make up VPA’s BCAA’s are L-Leucine, L-Isoleucine and L-Valine, and these amino acids are the building blocks of protein in their simplest form. Because of their simple form, VPAs BCAA’s have the ability to digest into your blood stream almost instantly and start working to repair and build muscles. If you are looking for fast recovery from intensive physical exercise BCAA’s are for you, if you are wanting to protect your muscles from catabolism and wasting away than BCAA’s are for you, if you are wanting to fuel your muscles to get the most out of your training and physical performance than BCAA’s are for you.
