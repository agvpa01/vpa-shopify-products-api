## Description

What is Beta Alanine? Beta alanine is a version of the amino acid alanine. Beta alanine is a natural compound that we make within our bodies and consume when we eat animal products. Unlike other amino acids, which are the building block of protein, Beta alanine is used by our bodies, along with another amino acid called histodine, to form another natural compound called carnosine. The benefits of supplementing with Beta alanine are due to the increased levels of carnosine that result. Beta alanine is a version of the amino acid alanine.
