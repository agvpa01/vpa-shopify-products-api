## Description

What is citrulline malate? Citrulline is a combination of citrulline and another compound called malate, which is important for energy production. Citrulline is important in the production of arginine which relaxes blood vessels, improves blood flow and increases production of nitric oxide in the blood. Since taking citrulline malate can help improve blood flow, increase energy and endurance, as well muscle recovery, this product is highly recommended to endurance athletes (cyclists, runners, etc.), strength athletes (weightlifters, bodybuilders, etc.), those who enjoy and need an enhanced post-workout pump and especially those who need help recovering faster after workouts.Citrulline is a combination of citrulline and another compound called malate, which is important for energy production.
