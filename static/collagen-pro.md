## Description

What is VPA's Collagen Protein Powder? Collagen Hydrolysate is a unique combination of amino acids that can promote healing and conditioning over other protein. Collagen Hydrolysate offers numerous benefits for joints, bones, tendons, ligaments, cartilage, skin, hair and nails. Collagen also supports blood vessels and organs such as the heart, kidneys and liver. The Probiotic, Bacillus coagulans strain, helps to improve gut health, joint health, nutrient absorption and reduces inflammation. It helps prevent the growth of bad bacteria (pathogenic microbes) and allows good bacteria (B. coagulans) to dominate the gut flora. The addition of prebiotic fibre (Inulin) helps to nourish the healthy bacteria in your gut to support probiotic function.
