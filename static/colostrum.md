## Description

HOW VPA'S COLOSTRUM OPTIMISES YOU VPA Bovine Colostrum is a rich source of many biologically active proteins, immunoglobulins, lactoferrin and other factors that promote lean muscle tissue growth. Colostrum contains immune supporting properties, particularly IgG antibodies, which are the ultimate building block to build muscle. Colostrum is the food source produced by mother mammals for the new-born babies for the first few days after birth. It gives the new-born a boost in nutrients which allow it to experience rapid growth before the mother’s milk is then produced.
