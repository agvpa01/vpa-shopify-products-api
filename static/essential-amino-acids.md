## Description

product Information What Are Essential Amino Acids (EAAs)? Essential Amino Acids (EAAs) are the nine amino acids your body can’t produce on its own. These include leucine, isoleucine, valine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and histidine. Since you must get them from food or supplements, taking an essential amino acids supplement ensures your body always has the building blocks for muscle protein synthesis. EAAs enhance muscle function and strength, helping to build lean mass. They also support muscle recovery, boost fat metabolism, reduce muscle breakdown, and enable overall performance optimisation. Whether you're training hard or simply want to support your health, EAAs supplements like that from VPA provide your body with the fuel it needs to thrive.
